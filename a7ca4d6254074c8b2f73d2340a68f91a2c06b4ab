      "message": "A few questions:\n\n- the spec does not talk about the sampling frequency.  what is it?  is there any value in making the sampling frequency configurable?\n\n- when enabled, does this monitor all neutron ports or only ports that have a qos bw limit rule applied?\n\n- is there any value to making this per port ?  that is, I could imagine that the workloads on different Neutron ports could have different characteristics and so a different drop threshold might be interesting in those cases.  \n\n- are the statistics being monitored already being gathered and this features is just utilizing them, or does this feature need to start polling/monitoring when its enabled?  If the latter, then maybe a possible new scaling concern?",
