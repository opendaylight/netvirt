      "message": "A few questions:\n\n- the spec does not talk about the sampling frequency.  what is it?  is there any value in making the sampling frequency configurable?\n\n- when enabled, does this monitor all neutron ports or only ports that have a qos bw limit rule applied?\n\n- is there any value to making this per port ?  that is, I could imagine that the workloads on different Neutron ports could have different characteristics and so a different drop threshold might be interesting in those cases.  \n\n- are the statistics being monitored already being gathered and this features is just utilizing them, or does this feature need to start polling/monitoring when its enabled?  If the latter, then maybe a possible new scaling concern?",

      "message": "•Sampling frequency is 5 minutes. Updated same in spec. Currently sampling frequency configurable is not configurable.\n\n•when enabled, neutron ports having qos bw limit rule are monitored. Updated same in spec.\n\n• Currently threshold is global configuration. Since threshold is specified as drop ratio i.e. drop %, its independent of port rate. This is made global to simplify the configuration. It\u0027s value is expected to be configured little higher than tolerable limit of most \u0027sensitive\u0027 neutron ports.           \n\n• Ports statistics are already gathered and this feature just utilizing the same.",
