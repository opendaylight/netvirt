      "message": "yeah, I think Carbon was our last release that didn\u0027t *try* to be in sync with OpenStack. So we can say Ocata to Pike if we want,\nor just Ocata is fine with me. Then from there onward, I think/hope we are now in sync. Nitro/Pike, Oxygen/Queens, Fluorine/(R release)\n\nfeels like we are on track at the moment right? Oxygen is releasing with Queens. Nitro should be fine with Pike, etc.",
