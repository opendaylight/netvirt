Obviously IT/UT must be ok because that would be blocking\nmerges, etc.\n\nis it just the case that we don\u0027t have any tests?",

CSIT probably does not catch a missing cache (it\u0027s just a performance impact; not sure if measurable).  Re. IT/UT/CT, there simply are none... ;-) That\u0027s why I\u0027m working so much on Component Test infra.",
