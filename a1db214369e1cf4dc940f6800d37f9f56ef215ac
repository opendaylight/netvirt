      "message": "The patch-port is from br-int to any other bridge which has external provider port. It can be br-prv or br-ext as well.\nThere is trunk interface that is created corresponding to this patch-port on br-int. Earlier the vlan member interface with tag of the network on the patch-port was created at the time of network creation. Now, this vlan member interface will be created once there is VM interface on the switch in this network.",
