      "message": "why do want to keep if-else here and unnecessary code? remote dmac flow entry differs only in egress action for both vxlan and vlan provider network. So you could have this check only in method ElanUtils#buildRemoteDmacFlowEntry where egress actions is retrieved.",

      "message": "The reason I did it like this was that if you look carefully setupRemoteDmacFlow/Vlan have slightly different input parameters. It\u0027s true that the generated flow differs only in the action but slightly different inputs are required to build those actions. Obviously, I could still collapse these relatively cleanly into a single function if you think that is necessary.",
