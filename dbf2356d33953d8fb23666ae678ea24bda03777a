The method that differs between Vlan/Flat and Vxlan/Gre can be abstract in ConntrackBasedSnatService and have two implementation Flat/VLan and Vxlan/Gre implementing the abstract method.\n\nIt is good that it is not moved to AbstractSnatSerivce as it is better not specific to conntrack implementation.",
