      "message": "There was a clear reason why only those ovs-datapaths with atleast one port available on the routed subnet, were elected as NAPT Switches.\n\nThe NAPT Switch needs to have remote flow rules for every possible floating-ip and internal-ip within the DC.  These remote flow rules are required for internal-ip for a successful intra-DC Reverse SNAT Traffic enablement and remote rules for floating-ip are required for a successful intra-DC DNAT-to-DNAT traffic enablement.\n\nIf you retain some switch that is not having a participating \nport on the router, how will traffic flow work?",
