      "message": "The use of this method is changed here and it\u0027s difficult to read and understand it as the name of it implies that it checks if the floating IP is present for the DPN - without any reference to other floating IPs.\nAs it\u0027s a Util method others might try to use it and it might be confusing - it was confusing to me :)\n\nMaybe having 2 different methods (one that checks that floating is present and other that it\u0027s present but not the only one).\nOr at least changing the tunnelTableCreateFlat variable name to something like shouldCheckFipIsNotOnlyOneOnDpn (long but clearer).\n\nWhat do you think?",
