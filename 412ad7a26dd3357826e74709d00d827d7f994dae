      "message": "@Manu, \n\nThanks for your comment.\n \nIf it is available already in interfacemgr we can re-use that. No problem.\n\nCan you please point out where exactly we are storing the egress action for each IPv6 enabled port in InterfaceMgr. So that we can re-use.\n\nI could see each port we are querying the InterfaceMgr RPC call to get the value.\n\nThanks in Advance!!\nKarthikeyan.",

The entries added to egressActionForInterfaceMap() will be deleted as soon as the object is deleted.\n\nAlso, on the other hand, if we are caching the GetEgressActionsForInterface and if there is any change in the egressActions (will there be any changes?), then how do we update our cache?",

      "message": "Thanks for your valuable comment.\n\nI have re-implemented in different way. This time i am keeping cache in existing VM interface list with additionally storing egress action as well. This will be taking care of both ADD/REMOVE of the cache. With this changes i have locally tested and working as expected.\n\nNote: In Ipv6Service Module(NeutronPortChangeListener.java) we need to ignore DHCP (Both ODL and Openstack q-dhcp) port and IPv4 Floating-IP addition/removal. Since as of now DHCP and Floating-Ip ports are consider as a host interface.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any concern about this changes.\n\nThanks in Advance,\nKarthikeyan.",
