      "message": "Will the function calls \"associateRouterToVPN\" and \"handleRouterInterfaceAdded\" execute in parallel? The question is: If we are adding ports to subnets and at the same time adding router to BGP VPN, will it work correctly?\n\nAlso, what happens when we delete subnet to a router while the above function call is getting executed? Will the assignment of the address family be serialized across the two calls (associateRouterToVPN and addSubnetToRouter)?",
