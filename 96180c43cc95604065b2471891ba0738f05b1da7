      "message": "Will the function calls \"associateRouterToVPN\" and \"handleRouterInterfaceAdded\" execute in parallel? The question is: If we are adding ports to subnets and at the same time adding router to BGP VPN, will it work correctly?\n\nAlso, what happens when we delete subnet to a router while the above function call is getting executed? Will the assignment of the address family be serialized across the two calls (associateRouterToVPN and addSubnetToRouter)?",

      "message": "@Ashvin,\n   \"associateRouterToVPN\" and \"handleRouterInterfaceAdded\"(If it is first IPv4/IPv6 subnet to router) methods can execute in parallel for the same VPN Instance with the help of JC with VPN Instance name as a key. Which ever the events gets invoked first it will be placed in the VPN Instance queue then it will process one by one based on the sequence of the events received.\n\nThe same logic also applicable for when subnet is removed from the router(last IPv4/IPv6 subnet only).\n\nThanks,\nKarthikeyan.",
