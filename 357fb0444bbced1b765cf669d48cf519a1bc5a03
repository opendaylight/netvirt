      "message": "Since determining which router is the default router depends solely on the order of events this is an issue for upgrade. During upgrade ODL\u0027s md-sal cache is wiped and then re-synced by some upgrade orchestrator (in our case networking-odl). In this case the entity doing the re-sync will not necessarily know (neutron doesn\u0027t know!) which router association came first which can result in a different order of creation and therefor a different default router selection. \nNote that in general this is not a great design since the order in which objects and associations are created is not a formalized part of the API specification.",
