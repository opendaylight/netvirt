      "message": "There is a fundamental issue here :\n\nWhen a router (say Router-1)with one subnet is created (say IPv4 subnet) , createL3InternalVpn() -\u003e associateRouterToInternalVpn() -\u003e addSubnetToVpn() is called . Say IPv4 subnet has one port (say Port-1) . For this VpnInterface is created in this method with IPv4 address adjacency. When second subnet (say IPv6 subnet) is added to the same router Router-1 , handleRouterInterfaceAdded() -\u003e addSubnetToVpn() is called . In addSubnetToVpn() , for the same port Port-1 , createVpnInterface() is being called where for the same interface IPv6 adjacency is added and syncWrite is called. Due to this behavior might be unpredictable in VpnInterfaceManager.\n\nBest design approach is , if port has IPs from 2 subnets , in current scenario it must check whether already there is VpnInterface. If yes , just add the new adjacency. \n\nTo maintain the backward compatibility , if port has only one IP , the current code should work as-is.",

Then handleRouterInterfaceRemoved () -\u003e removeSubnetFromVpn() -\u003e deleteVpnInterface() is called. This will go and delete the vpn-interfaces. This is a major BUG.\n\nThe design should be , if port has IPv4 and IPv6 addresses (i.e two subnets) , then VpnInterface needs to be updated. The adjacency corresponding to subnet being removed needs to be deleted from VpnInterface and update must be done. \n\nTo maintain backward compatibility , if port has only stack(IPv4 or IPv6) , when subnet is removed from router Router-1 , VpnInterface must be deleted.",
