I think the idea of leveraging full-sync is a perfect candidate for this.",

      "message": "Case 2 is per network MTU.  We need to get global mtu working first, and then see if per network MTU actually works.  That case is a legit one I think.  There has also been newer Neutron API exposed to set the network MTU rather than doing it in conf:\nhttps://review.openstack.org/#/c/483518/\n\nCase 3 is path_mtu being used as the MTU for VXLAN/GRE overlay networks instead of global physnet MTU.  To me this naming/usage isn\u0027t clear.  I think we can avoid this for now and just use global network mtu and the per network.",
