      "message": "This is confusing, and actually wrong - because you do not @RunWith(MockitoRunner.class) here, you don\u0027t really use Mockito (which is a Good Thing, you should not have to), so this field will just be null - the @Mock annotation does not do anything, if there is nothing active to act on it.  I was curious to understand why your test passed anyway, and dug a bit into it, to realize that the code under test here, in OpenFlow13Provider, does not actually seem to require a DataBroker?  So let\u0027s clean that up, see https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/#/c/54447/, then this make more sense - you\u0027ll be able to just remove this @Mock private DataBroker dataBroker completely.",
