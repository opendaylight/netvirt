      "message": "Currently, the ACL feature is a very specific one and sits under the ACL service. Our goal is to develop a more generic bundle, that aside from retrieving port/flow counters on request, will also enable to add a new service (used with Genius infrastructure) that enables getting filtered counters sent/received from a specific network element IP. This is described here: https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/#/c/50771/.\nMaybe in the future it will be possible to merge the ACL counters logic to this bundle.",
