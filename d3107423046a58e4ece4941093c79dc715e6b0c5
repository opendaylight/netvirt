The landing OVS is used only when BGP VPN is attached to the router. \n\nIf there is no BGP VPN configured, then landing OVS is not required. The FIB (or the subnet routing table) can contain the relevant CIDR based on which the packet is punted to the controller. This can be done with from every OVS in a distributed fashion. There is no need for having a landing OVS.",
