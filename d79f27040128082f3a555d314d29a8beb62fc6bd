      "message": "I see fundamental issue with this design approach :\n\n\"vpnInterface.getVpnInstanceName().get(0)\" will always give only one router VPN Instance Name. So this vpninterface/port will always be part of the same router instance which might be either of IPv4/IPv6. VpnInterface IPv4 adj is part of Router1(IPv4) capable and VpnInterface IPv6 adj is part of Router2(IPv6) capable.\n\nWhen BGP-VPN is created and these two routes i.e Router1 and Router2 are associated with BGP-VPN , the swap of interface from internal-VPN(Router VPN) to BGP-VPN will fail",
