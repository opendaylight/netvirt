      "message": "this is quite weird and doesn\u0027t really make sense... it looks like you are interested in using the AbstractConcurrentDataBrokerTest, which offers you a \"real\" (not Mock) test implementation of DataBroker (which is good and is what I now recommend everyone use; but please use the ConstantSchemaAbstractDataBrokerTest instead of the AbstractConcurrentDataBrokerTest as it will be noticeably faster as soon as you use more than 1 of them in the project), yet you still use @RunWith(MockitoJUnitRunner.class) and @Mock DataBroker and the transactions... why?  The idea is that you do not have to Mock DataBroker and Txs thanks to the AbstractConcurrentDataBrokerTest - so I would remove this.  See also https://wiki.opendaylight.org/view/BestPractices/Tests",
