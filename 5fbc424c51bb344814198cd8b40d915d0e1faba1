      "message": "The old code was adding dhcp designated switch tep ip as a physical locator, but I don\u0027t see that in your patch. How is that handled with the new code? I\u0027m not super familiar with that part of the code, maybe it is handled in some other logic?",

The same check was removed. To improve the perf this has been done. But now we introduced Resourcebatchmanager and it would be faster . So now i retained the old code.",
