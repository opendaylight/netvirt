      "message": "Hi Vivek,\n\n  Checking !\u003dnull may not solve NullPointerException. Actual root cause of this problem is occurring on following scenario.\n\nOn Non-NAPT Switch has FIP configured and trying to remove/disassociate last FIP at that time we will not get Floating-IP Address from vpn-to-dpn-list model. Hence it is throwing NullPointerException.\n\n\nTo address this problem properly we need to put try-catch block for capturing NullPointerException. With this try-catch block code changes, i have tested locally and it was working as expected.\n\nThanks,\nKarthikeyan.",
