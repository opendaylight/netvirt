      "message": "I agree with you @Abhinav. The original implementation only focused on a single IP per port and that too IPv4.\n\nThis patch addresses the issue mentioned in the commit message, but there is an underlying issue that I wanted to bring to attention.\nNow that we are adding full support for IPv6 via L3VPN, it is important to handle them properly.\n\nWhen a port has multiple fixedIps, there could be a possible race since get(0).getSubnetId() could differ between original and update.\n@Vivek, what are your thoughts on this?",
