      "message": "I agree with you @Abhinav. The original implementation only focused on a single IP per port and that too IPv4.\n\nThis patch addresses the issue mentioned in the commit message, but there is an underlying issue that I wanted to bring to attention.\nNow that we are adding full support for IPv6 via L3VPN, it is important to handle them properly.\n\nWhen a port has multiple fixedIps, there could be a possible race since get(0).getSubnetId() could differ between original and update.\n@Vivek, what are your thoughts on this?",

      "message": "I agree, this is a valid point because there is no ordering guarantees with yang lists.\n\nAt the same time, however, this has to be fixed in a different review for supporting dualstack VMs rather than in this review.\n\nWe need to make sure single stack VMs that may be only IPv4 (or) only IPv6 are working correctly and this fix falls in line with that.\n\nSo I think we should take this fix.",
