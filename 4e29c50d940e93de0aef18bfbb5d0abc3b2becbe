      "message": "I picked up on this as well... actually, you cannot; this just happens to not cause any damage because vpnmanager-impl/pom.xml does not currently have the blueprint plugin, and even if it did it would cause no effect until this class was annotated @Singleton.  It could cause confusing in the future though, so I would prefer if this patch would not add @PostConstruct everywhere - as it\u0027s got nothing to do with the DJC -\u003e JC migration, right?\n\nPS: If you would like to migrate vpnmanager-impl (and everything else!) from BP XML to annotations, then I\u0027m all for that, but I would do it as a separate change.",
