      "message": "I picked up on this as well... actually, you cannot; this just happens to not cause any damage because vpnmanager-impl/pom.xml does not currently have the blueprint plugin, and even if it did it would cause no effect until this class was annotated @Singleton.  It could cause confusing in the future though, so I would prefer if this patch would not add @PostConstruct everywhere - as it\u0027s got nothing to do with the DJC -\u003e JC migration, right?\n\nPS: If you would like to migrate vpnmanager-impl (and everything else!) from BP XML to annotations, then I\u0027m all for that, but I would do it as a separate change.",

      "message": "I didn\u0027t mean to leave this in - I was attempting to convert all of it to use the injection annotations but that proved to be problematic with circular dependencies (need to break the circular - but that\u0027s too much for this patch). But PostConstruct here doesn\u0027t hurt anything - in fact the base class uses @PostConstruct and @PreDestroy. These only come into play if you have BP annotation plugin, or some tool that uses them, enabled. Even then you need @Singleton as well.",
