      "message": "Michael, any constructive advice on correcting this behavior besides blocking the commit?\n\nThough I agree this isn\u0027t elegant at all, this is existing behavior already taking place around Uuid creation, since new Uuid initialization throws exceptions (see VpnInterfaceManager for example).\n\nWe could add a boolean method that validates if a port name has a valid Uuid syntax - but this seems out of scope for this bug fix. Would also like Vivek/Vishal\u0027s input as this is old code behavior that we have inherited.",
