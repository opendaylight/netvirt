      "message": "Agree that pattern is bad and should replace it, but am not sure if caller code is written well enough to handle propagation. Would prefer it taken up in a separate patch/Jira/activity that makes sure don\u0027t end up breaking anything by propagating exception. IIRC, early days there were issues where listener threads just crashed if there was an uncaught exception.",
