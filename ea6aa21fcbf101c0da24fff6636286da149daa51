      "message": "Yes Kalai, the additional padding after \u0027:\u0027 is not really required as its like having a zero before a number. \n\nFor a MAC address \"0a:16:03:04:08:0c\", the LLA that is configured on the VMs is fe80::816:3ff:fe04:80c (shortened form)\n\nWithout this fix, the LLA that is generated by this api was \n fe80::816:03ff:fe04:080c\n\nAlthough both are technically correct, the string comparison was failing. So, I modified the api to generate LLA that matches with the LLA addresses configured by the hosts. Also added a corresponding unit test.",
