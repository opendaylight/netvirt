      "message": "I can think of a lot more cases than this, but at least we should expand to\nadding up to 4 VRFs here somehow. that will at least cover what happens\nwhen one compute with base_weight 0 gets 2 VRFS making it\u0027s weight also\n2 and then the additional 2 more VRFs should give us an end state where\nboth computes are now having a weight of 3.\n\nunless I misunderstood how this all should work.",
