      "message": "Now we have extra-routes stored in separate container , but not in VpnInterface adj. When add() for an extra-route entry is triggered , you are not checking whether south-bound state for the parent interface is available. In the earlier code , since extra-route was part of VpnInterace Adj , we used to check for the south-bound state. If south-bound state for parent interface is received later , you are not handling the extra-route FIB creation in new code.",

      "message": "Yes, I think its better to add that check.\nActually the interfaceName (line 149) will be filled only if there is a VM booted on the nextHop. Else, it will be null. If an extra-route is added without a VM for its nexthop, then the interfaceName attribute will be filled on a interface state up event and the update() method will be called.\n\nSo, for the case where VM is booted but for some reasone interface state is not present, I guess we can add that additional check as well. Please let me knoe your thoughts.",
