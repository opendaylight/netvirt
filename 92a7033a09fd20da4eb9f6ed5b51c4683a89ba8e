      "message": "Now we have extra-routes stored in separate container , but not in VpnInterface adj. When add() for an extra-route entry is triggered , you are not checking whether south-bound state for the parent interface is available. In the earlier code , since extra-route was part of VpnInterace Adj , we used to check for the south-bound state. If south-bound state for parent interface is received later , you are not handling the extra-route FIB creation in new code.",
