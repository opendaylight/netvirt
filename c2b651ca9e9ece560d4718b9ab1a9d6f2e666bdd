      "message": "There is a fundamental bug here:\n\nSay we have created a bgpvpn i.e vpn1 . Then we add two routers i.e Router1(IPv4) , Router2(IPv6) to bgpvpn vpn1. VpnMap for vpn1 will contain both the routers.\n\nSay Router2 is dis-associated frpm vpn1 . Then cleanFromVpnMaps is called for Router2. Router list is being set with null (at line-660), eventhough Router1 is still part of the same VPN.",
