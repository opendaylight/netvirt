      "message": "I would like to tight down the verification of the this and other similar tests a bit more. At the very least:\n\n- Assert on the expected length of matchBuilds\n- Assert on the expected length of srcTcpMatches\n\nIdeally though, you would build on the test the List\u003cMatchBuilder\u003e that you expect, and just compare that with the one you get. \n\nWhen I can, I usually like to setup my test data in class static arrays. For example, one array A for lower port, array B for upper port (you can have more arrays if you want to account for both src and dst ports combinations), array C for the expected List\u003cMatchBuilder\u003e. Then you can do something like assertEquals(C[i], sut(A[i],B[i])). \n\nThat can then be moved onto a parameterized test easily, should the number of samples we want to test increase.",
