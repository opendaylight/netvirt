      "message": "It doesn\u0027t have any effect right now as we do not support configuring these values anyway in our deployment. However fwiw I don\u0027t think this is a good change. The rename doesn\u0027t make much sense. I get that the point is to try to use a common setting for both protocols, but I think the new name causes more confusion than the benefit of consolidating the variables. arp-timeout and ipv6-nd-timeout probably make more sense here. \n\nWhy is arp-cache-size renamed to migrate-ip-cache-size? I don\u0027t know what the word \u0027migrate\u0027 signifies. If you want to use a single setting for ipv4 and ipv6 for this and its just the amount of entries you can hold for the ARP or ND cache, then I would call it like l3-cache-size.",

      "message": "@Tim,\nThe intention here is to keep single cache to store the IP\u0027s (both IPv4 and IPv6) to deal with IP migration scenarios during the process of learning the hidden IP\u0027s.\nSince it was used specifically for IP migration scenarios, it was named as \"migrate-ip-cache-size\". \n\nI don\u0027t think so \"l3-cache-size\" suites in this case as the name is very generic.\nAny other suggestions please?",
