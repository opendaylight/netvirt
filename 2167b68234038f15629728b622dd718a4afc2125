      "message": "It doesn\u0027t have any effect right now as we do not support configuring these values anyway in our deployment. However fwiw I don\u0027t think this is a good change. The rename doesn\u0027t make much sense. I get that the point is to try to use a common setting for both protocols, but I think the new name causes more confusion than the benefit of consolidating the variables. arp-timeout and ipv6-nd-timeout probably make more sense here. \n\nWhy is arp-cache-size renamed to migrate-ip-cache-size? I don\u0027t know what the word \u0027migrate\u0027 signifies. If you want to use a single setting for ipv4 and ipv6 for this and its just the amount of entries you can hold for the ARP or ND cache, then I would call it like l3-cache-size.",
