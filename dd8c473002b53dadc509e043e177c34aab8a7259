      "message": "Agree with your first point - even I noticed that we can either flood or send to a particular port. Added this comment, so that we can re-visit (if packetProcessingService is updated in future).\n\nFor the second point:\nSince we are maintaining a list of DpnIDs \u003c--\u003e List(ofPorts) \"per network\", the idea was to output same RA across all the ports that belong to the network. For a different network, I agree that we will be using a different prefix info in the RA.\n\nHowever, if you are trying to convey that even for the same network depending on the output port the \"RA payload\" would vary - can you elaborate it? AFAIU, we can use the same RA content for all the ports on the network. I see that we can further optimize the solution by re-using the txPayload in transmitRtrAdvertisement. I\u0027ll wait for your comments before making any changes. Thanks.",
