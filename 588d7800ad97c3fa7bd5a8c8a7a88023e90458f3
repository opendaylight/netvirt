      "message": "Was reading this again - why do we update ElanForwardingTables? When is this model used?\n\nIf it is important for some functionality - I\u0027m afraid we are not maintaining it correctly: \nIf we learn mac X on VlanProviderIface1 \u0026 VlanProviderIface2, we will have X in ElanForwardingTables. But when X entry will time out in one of the interfaces(VlanProviderIface1 for example), X will be removed ElanForwardingTables even though it still exists in VlanProviderIface2.\n\nAm I reading this correctly? If so, can you shed some light on when ElanForwardingTables is used? (couldn\u0027t find anything that uses it)\n\nAnyway - Your review still looks good to me, as the behavior I described above existed before your changes..",
