      "message": "Remove this log since the method does not do anything.\n\nOr should we have code in here which reads from the southbound and populates the mdsal? triggerUpdates() is typically called when an openflow node is first added to update anything that might have happened previously - like a set of compute nodes were up and tunnels already created but now this new node needs to be included.\n\nThis probably isn\u0027t a likely scenario, though, since the ovsdbUpdate() should be called - and that is where you would likely call triggerUpdates().",
