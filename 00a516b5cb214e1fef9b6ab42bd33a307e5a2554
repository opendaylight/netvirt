      "message": "General question here:\nLet\u0027s say that the ELAN creation failed. Will the CLI user see the full stacktrace or just the exception message? \nIf the latter, this is a big mistake in my opinion, because it will make troubleshooting harder. One example: You got an NPE, will the user only see NPE without an opportunity to see where did the NPE stemmed from?",
