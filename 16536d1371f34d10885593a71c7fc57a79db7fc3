      "message": "I\u0027m not sure. wouldn\u0027t it lead to programming of ELAN groups and flows (which has group instruction to ELAN groups) in two different threads and run in parallel ? This might lead to flow mod errors due to group doesn\u0027t exist. Can you check it ?\nI also see jobkey is different here from the one which is used in ElanInterfaceManager. Moreover we don\u0027t have control here over which job should go first into job coordinator (even with same job key).\n\nHave you thought about just using lockmanager for programming bc groups ?",
