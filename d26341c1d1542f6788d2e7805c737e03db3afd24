      "message": "a. Please refer to pipeline.rst done by Vishal for tables naming - specifically is VLAN_INTERFACE_INGRESS_TABLE actually Classifier Table? LPORT_DISPATCHER is \"Dispatcher Table\"?\n\nb. Could you please note the actual changes to the current pipeline?\nThis illustration of the pipeline after the changes is nice, but requires knowledge of the pipeline before - it\u0027s difficult to understand the actual change from this.",

What are the actual changes to the current pipeline proposed by this change? :)\n\nThanks..",
