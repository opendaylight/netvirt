      "message": "my intention was to separate between things that are related to Neutron and Netvirt. In the long run, maybe separate completely the dhcp service from its \"users\" - the neutron dhcp and allocation pool dhcp implementations. I agree that the corner stone was indeed placed in the wrong place :) I assume that placing it in a new general neutron util class  in the dhcp package is more reasonable - agree?",
