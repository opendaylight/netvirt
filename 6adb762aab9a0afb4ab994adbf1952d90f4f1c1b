      "message": "you could just remove this TODO and BOTH @SuppressWarnings as well now (because the checkstyle:RegexpSinglelineJava is for System.out, which you\u0027ve removed here)... \n\nBUT while looking at this I think I got why this was done like this.. the way you have it, exception would not be shown to CLI users anymore (unless they have shell:stack-traces-print, which is false by default)\n\nSo because it\u0027s for a CLI the right solution is to re-throw to Karaf IMHO, as documented on https://wiki.opendaylight.org/view/BestPractices/Coding_Guidelines#IllegalCatch, so proposed on https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/#/c/63113/",
