We can remove that line.\n\nFor the second point, we can put that we donot intend to cover in our implementation Neutron Ports that contain more than one IPv4 and IPv6 addresses within them.   \n\nMore specifically we will cover Neutron Port that will have only one IPv4 and one IPv6 address.   \n\nWe will create two networks and one each of that network will either have a single IPv4 (or) a single IPv6 subnet.  We will use that network to spin off the single Neutron Port that will be part of two subnets where each subnet holds a different ether type.",
