      "message": "I\u0027m afraid, this is not the right fix. AFAIU this will unconditionally remove the FIB entry for the dhcp-port.\n\nUnlike ODL DHCP Server, Neutron dhcp-agent is a \"real tap interface in a namespace\", so external-servers/VMs-in-other-network should be able to reach dhcp-port (if necessary). \nThe Original issue was that when we did not associate a router to the subnet, FIB entry should not be present. The patch should solve it and not unconditionally remove the entry. Also please update the bug description.",
