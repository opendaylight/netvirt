Which is to take advantage of existing logging infrastructure instead of creating a new (additional) logging infrastructure.  (some other comments/replies suggested that the new plain text file could be used for other logging/alerts that might be created in the future.)\n\nI didn\u0027t know enough about log4j to suggest something like Tali, but if you could satisfy your requirement using log4j then that would address my comment also.",

Though, I observed that I was able to change the log file name dynamically in org.ops4j.pax.logging.cfg without restarting the controller but only reason log file was made configurable so that it can be modified by directly from karaf shell command and RESTCONF.\n\nLet me know if there is any log4j java API to change the same through java program or is there a way same can be set through karaf shell command?\n\nAlso, I see org.ops4j.pax.logging.cfg is present in \u0027target\u0027 dir and I am not able to find original source for org.ops4j.pax.logging.cfg where I can make the changes and define new appender for qos with default values like file name, size and max backup index. could you please point me to source org.ops4j.pax.logging.cfg file.\n\nAlso, there is suggestion from Eric (please see above) to use karaf DEBUG log by default for logging and use text file only if its really required and configured by user. This approach is more flexible and provides both the options.",
