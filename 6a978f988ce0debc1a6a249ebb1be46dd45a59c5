      "message": "Yes, we can merge ACL5 with ACL6. Only concern is we might have to omit matching on \"ct_state\u003d+trk\" which should be fine  as we can assume rest of the traffic (excluding est, rel, inv) will be tracked (+trk) anyways. \n\nDo you see any issues by omitting match on \"ct_state\u003d+trk\"?",
