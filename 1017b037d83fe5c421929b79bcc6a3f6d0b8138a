      "message": "what do we mean by handling?\n\nWe should be clear what the Spec is going to accomplish..\n\nThis specification proposes to bring in a feature into NetVirt enabling OpenDaylight controller to provide Intra-DC L2-switching and L3-forwarding support for DualStack VMs.  DualStack VMs are virtual machines that will have 2 L3-identities.  More specifically, DualStack VMs will have a single network interface in them (i.e., single VNIC) but that interface will actively hold both an IPv4 and IPv6 address.\n\nIn addition to providing initial support for DualStack VMs, this Spec ensures that such DualStack VMs work on BGPVPNs too.",
