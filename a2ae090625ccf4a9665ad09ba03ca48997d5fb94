      "message": "the only difference between this new code and AclServiceOFFlowBuilder.getResubmitInstructionInfo() seems to be that (a) it adds this ActionNxCtClear, and (b) it uses the tableId instead of the dispatcherTableId for the ActionNxResubmit.  \n\nseeing that AclServiceOFFlowBuilder.getResubmitInstructionInfo is also used in 2 other places in addition to here, I\u0027m wondering if ActionNxCtClear should just be added to it and called with tableId instead of the dispatcherTableId to affect all 3 places?  \n\nOr may be this is a bad idea and this only needs to change here?",

      "message": "Michael,\nThis fix is need for an urgent bug d/s.\n\nYour review comment (a good one, btw) is more about possible optimization. Would you be ok if that is addressed when Aswin can take a look later? I don\u0027t know the answer either, Aswin can let us know when he has a chance. Thanks.",

      "message": "Thanks Vic, Micheal for the review.\n\nI didn\u0027t use the existing method since I want the ct_clear action to be the first one and the resubmit follow it. But with getResubmitInstructionInfo, I could not make it the first action as it creating a new list. I will see if it I can reuse the method with some modification.\n\nThe change to tableId from dispatcher table was an oversight. It should be dispatcher table itself. The last run in CSIT had some failures due to this. Pushed a new patch and expect a better result in the new run.",
