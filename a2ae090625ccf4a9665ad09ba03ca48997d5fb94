      "message": "the only difference between this new code and AclServiceOFFlowBuilder.getResubmitInstructionInfo() seems to be that (a) it adds this ActionNxCtClear, and (b) it uses the tableId instead of the dispatcherTableId for the ActionNxResubmit.  \n\nseeing that AclServiceOFFlowBuilder.getResubmitInstructionInfo is also used in 2 other places in addition to here, I\u0027m wondering if ActionNxCtClear should just be added to it and called with tableId instead of the dispatcherTableId to affect all 3 places?  \n\nOr may be this is a bad idea and this only needs to change here?",

      "message": "Michael,\nThis fix is need for an urgent bug d/s.\n\nYour review comment (a good one, btw) is more about possible optimization. Would you be ok if that is addressed when Aswin can take a look later? I don\u0027t know the answer either, Aswin can let us know when he has a chance. Thanks.",
