      "message": "the only difference between this new code and AclServiceOFFlowBuilder.getResubmitInstructionInfo() seems to be that (a) it adds this ActionNxCtClear, and (b) it uses the tableId instead of the dispatcherTableId for the ActionNxResubmit.  \n\nseeing that AclServiceOFFlowBuilder.getResubmitInstructionInfo is also used in 2 other places in addition to here, I\u0027m wondering if ActionNxCtClear should just be added to it and called with tableId instead of the dispatcherTableId to affect all 3 places?  \n\nOr may be this is a bad idea and this only needs to change here?",
