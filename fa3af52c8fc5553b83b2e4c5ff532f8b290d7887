How do you visualize it, and see problems?  I would have thought that\u0027s completely pointless... there is actually, already, a better alternative for this - have you noticed how, (only) if the assert fails, then org.opendaylight.mdsal.binding.testutils.AssertDataObjects.assertEqualByText(String, Object), which is called by both of the above, prints you a nice proper diff?",

      "message": "The current assert output string definitely helps to identify specific mismatches. But it might be hard to debug all the cases with this string.\n\nBelow are the cases, which I can think of where we need all the flows for comparison.\n- If there are multiple mismatches, the current assert output points to only one mismatch/issue at a time.\n- For debugging ordering issues, I found it difficult with the current assert output. Instead I can simply copy expected and actual flows in two separate files, format it and use some compare tool for comparison. \n\nFinally, I don\u0027t see any harm in having log statements (with huge data) for UT\u0027s. Maybe some extra code but helps for debugging.",

I\u0027ll have to trust you! ;-)\n\nWould it be acceptable to you if the LOG.info of the full flow would only be printed if there is a mismatch (failed assertion), but not if everything is OK as expected?  And then we could even make it a LOG.warn instead of info.  If you confirm this is acceptable to you, then one of us should raise a change for that in Genius, and then we can finally merge this change here into netvirt - sounds like a plan?  Do you want to propose the respective change in genius, or shall I?",
