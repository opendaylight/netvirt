      "message": "Why is this boolean required? \nIf I remember clearly, a VrfEntryListener().update was only doing a createFibEntry() and not calling the deleteFibEntry(). This was causing problems with the refCount in the vpnNextHop.\nIs this boolean added to compensate for that problem?\nIf yes, then how does this change help? Following are the concerns:\n\n1) When there is a router-update for extra-route, delete is not called, and only create is called. This leads to unnecessary increase in flowRefCount. But the above check does not handle this situation right? You need to compensate for that extra flowRefCount right? \n\n2) If you are only deleting local adjacency, only if its not an extraroute, how will you reduce the refCount for extra-Route? Because I see that the refCount increment if its extra route is still present in checkCreateLocalFibEntry() right? You have not changed it. In that case, for a scenario where both primary adj and extra route exists, the group will never get deleted right?\n\nFinally, a proper boolean based approach is acceptable to fix this issue for now. But please add appropriate comments, as the right fix for this would need considerable refactoring(I think), and SHOULD BE done in the future.",
