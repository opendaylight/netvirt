When this VM initiates ping to PNF, the it undergoes DNAT tranlation(in compute2) and hit table\u003d21-\u003egoto_table:22(in compute2) for PNF discovery. \n\nNow, when FIP is detached and ping is initiated, this packet will be forwarded to Compute-1(for SNAT translation as VM2 is part of same Router). If Controller-Based SNAT used, then this ICMP packet will be dropped by CSC as it only support TCP/UDP.\n\nBut, from logs, I see conntrack-based SNAT used and ICMP is supported. So, Packet will under-go SNAT translation and and re-submitted to table\u003d21 where we have Subnet-route flow(on compute1 - 8796751999625) for PNF discovery.\n\nPlease verify packet from Compute2 to Compute1 reached and has Conntrack SNAT translation happened and submitted to table\u003d21 for external-subnet route handling.",
