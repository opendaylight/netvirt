Then, BUM packets from L3 to external network will be sent to all ports on the br-int.\n\nBut two interfaces of one L3 are connected to one br-int.\n\nHence, the BUM packets will be reached at L3 interface to connect to the tenant internal network.\n\nIs my understanding right? Or is there any any impact of this situation?",
