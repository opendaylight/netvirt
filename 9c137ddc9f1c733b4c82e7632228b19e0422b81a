      "message": "this kind of reverse coupling looks to complicate things ...\n\nWe are listening on an OPERATIONAL datastore that is looking southbound but using that to build up a Neutron Config that is fed Northbound...  \n\nFrom the flow, it looks like you want to enable ExternalVpnInterface creation on every DPN where the Router VPN is available.  \n\nIdeally you need a Network Driven engine here wherein if that Network is flat/vlan AND is available on a DPN, you are creating\nan externalVpnInterface.  And if the network disappears from the DPN, you are removing the externalVpnInterface.\n\nHave you thought about alternatives to this approach?",
