      "message": "Philipee, we are getting some new NPE in Line 98, because you are trying to config VPNInstance while that will never be available in the big if() condition [1st line] within this method.\n\nSince you need type information for deletion of VRF, can you please fetch that information from input operational vpnInstance itself.  If that info is not available there, please make odl-l3vpn.yang change to add the info you need (which looks to be getIpv4Family() and getType()) to the VpnInstancOpData container and use that here to do deleteVrf.",

      "message": "Hi Vivek,\nwith 57978 code, ipv4Family is always configured.\neven if router has no ipv4 subnet.\n\nHowever, that behaviour will change ( see commits 63210), since a yang model change will add some generic vpn-config to vpn instance from config DS.\n\n\nNow, about yang model change for vpn instance from oper DS: could you confirm this change is necessary ? What I want to do is the following: dynamically update the VpnInstance config ( ipv4-config, ipv6-config), if the router has IPv4 subnets, or ipv6 subnets.\nAs you can see, I am relying on changing config DS.\n\nIf i have to change oper DS, I can do that. however, for config DS vpn instance, is it a configuration parameter ?\nmeaning that if you don\u0027t configure ipv6-family, you don\u0027t have any ipv6 on oper DS ?",
