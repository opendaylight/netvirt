      "message": "There\u0027s actually no violation the way it was. There would be if there was a \"public static\" that wasn\u0027t final - seen that\u0027s elsewhere. Using an interface for constants is a pattern and simpler b/c vars are automatically \"public static final\" and avoids mistakes. Also if using a class, you don\u0027t really want to instantiate it so to be complete you make the class final with a private ctor, of course don\u0027t need to with interface.",
