To avoid these problems, ACL was updated to do rebind through bind updates rather than unbind/bind service. \n\nThe issue being fixed was working use case earlier. ie., remote ACL table was programmed with VPN id when VM\u0027s subnet was added as a router interface (The flow with elan id was getting updated with VPN Id). The flow was also getting updated with elan id whenever VM\u0027s subnet interface was removed from router.",
