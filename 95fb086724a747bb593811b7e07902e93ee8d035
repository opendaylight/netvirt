      "message": "The fix looks relevant. Thanks.\n\nJust for an open discussion:\n1. We seem to assume that a port can have only one IPv4 address. AFAIU, in Neutron it is possible to do a port-update and add additional ips to the fixed_ips field.\n\n2. It would be useful to add a comment saying that IPv6 is currently not supported in Controller based DHCPServer.",
