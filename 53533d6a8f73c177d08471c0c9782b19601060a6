      "message": "actually I think at least some of that you\u0027re after achieving here may be addressed by the ordering I\u0027m proposing in https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/#/c/53399/ - have a look? Some of it is probably complimentary too, and could and should go into genius, on top of c/53399.. if you do end up making a contribution to genius, it would be very cool if you could cover the functionality you\u0027re adding by extending the (new) TestIMdsalApiManagerTest from c/53394 accordingly, to illustrate and non-regression test the functionality you\u0027re adding, if possible at all.",
