This only happens once when the switch is first discovered. \n\nIt would be nice if there were a way to dynamically walk the schema and figure out which fields are \"config false\" and null them, but there is no real API for that.",

      "message": "I think a better approach would be to pick the fields we want to retain than null out ones we don\u0027t. Drawback with that would be a new field that gets added and we need to have it config. But that would fail some use case and be found, rather than failing write coz we writing config:false to config. So there is no one fixed solution here, this quirk is due to way we are \u0027creating\u0027 bridge that already exists.",
