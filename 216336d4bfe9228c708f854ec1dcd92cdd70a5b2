      "message": "the commit message needs to be fixed.\n\nWhen a physical switch on the cloud management network in the cloud is rebooted, it results in disconnection of datapath-nodes from the ODL controller.   Under such conditions, the subnetRoute is removed from all the DPNs.\n\nHowever, once the physical switch comes back up after reboot, the datapath-nodes are all getting reconnected to the ODL controller.  During this time in a scaled environment, the subnetRoute flow rules aren\u0027t getting reapplied to the datapath-nodes.  This is because the election process fails in figuring out a designated datapath-node for hosting subnetroute, thereby the subnetRoute is not getting reconfigured on all the datapath-nodes.",
