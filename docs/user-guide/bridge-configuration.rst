Bridge Configuration

The following describes OVS bridge configurations supported by OpenDaylight.

The "br-int" Bridge
-------------------
If the br-int bridge is not configured prior to the ovsdb manager connection with ODL,
ODL will create it. If br-int exists prior to the ovsdb manager connection, ODL will retain
any existing configurations on br-int. Note that if you choose to create br-int prior to
connecting to ODL, ``disable-in-band`` MUST be set to true and any flows configured may interfere
with the flows ODL will create. ODL will add the following configuration items to br-int:

1. ODL will set itself as br-int's controller
2. Any provider network configuration (see section "Provider Networks" below)

It is important to note that once the ovsdb manager connection is established with ODL, ODL
"owns" br-int and other applications should not modify its settings.

Provider Networks
-----------------
Provider networks should be configured prior to OVSDB connecting to ODL. These are configured
in the Open_vSwitch tableâ€™s other_Config column and have the format ``<physnet>:<connector>``
where ``<physnet>`` is the name of the provider network and ``<connector>`` is one of the following
three options:

1. The name of a local interface (ODL will add this port to br-int)
2. The name of a bridge on OpenVSwitch (ODL will create patch ports between br-int and this bridge)
3. The name of a port already present on br-int (ODL will use that port)

For example, assume your provider network is called extnet and it is attached to the eth0 interface
on your host you can set this in OVSDB using the following command:

``sudo ovs-vsctl set Open_vSwitch . Other_Config:provider_mappings=extnet:eth0``

If instead of ``eth0`` the provider network is accesable via on OVS bridge called ``br-int``, ``eth0`` in the
above command would be substituted with ``br-int``.
