Netvirt Design Specifications
=============================

Starting from Carbon, Netvirt uses RST format Design Specification document for
all new features. These specifications capture all aspects of a features design
and are peer reviewed before feature is implemented. If you want to write a new feature
go through existing specifications on how to write a spec. If you want to use existing
features then reading their spec is a great way to learn more about them.
