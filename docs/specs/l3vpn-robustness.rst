Enhance Robustness of L3VPN 
============================

https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/#/q/topic:l3vpn-robustness

Enhance current L3VPN to improve its robustness for specific
use-cases and also enable it to consistently work with
Neutron BGPVPN initiated orchestration lifecycles.

Problem description
===================

Being witness to issues faced in L3VPN with production
deployments of OpenDaylight, it was gradually becoming
clear that piecemeal fixing issues in L3VPN (and all its
related modules) unfortunately doesn't scale.

It was ascertained during fixing such issues (ie., providing
patches for production) that there was scope for improving
robustness in L3VPN.

There were specific cases that may (or) may not succeed most of the time in L3VPN.
* VM Migration
    - Specifically when VM being migrated is a parent of multiple IPAddresses (more than 4) where some are V4 and some V6.
* VM Evacuation
    - Mutliple VMs on a host, each evacuated VM being a parent of multiple IPAddresses, and the host made down.
* Speed up Router-association and Router-disassociation to a VPN lifecycle
* Graceful ECMP handling (i.e, ExtraRoute with multiple nexthops)
    - Modify an existing extra-route with additional nexthops.
    - Modify an existing extra-route by removing a nexthop from a list of configured nexthops.
    - Boot a VM, which is a nexthop for a pre-configured extra-route
    - Delete a VM, which is a nexthop for an extra-route
* Robust VIP/MIP Handling
  - MIP movement across VMs on different computes with VRRP configuration.
  - VM (holding MIP) migration.
  - MIP traffic impact on ODL cluster reboot.
  - MIP traffic impact on OVS disconnect/connect.
  - MIP Aliveness monitoring sessions are not persistent.

If you take a closer look, the first three bullets above require vpn-interface-based serialization across the cluster for
consistently driven control-plane + data-plane semantics.

Similarly if you look at next two bullets above (bullet 4 and 5), your will notice that those require IP-driven
serialization across the cluster for consistently driven control-plane + data-plane semantics.

However, today the entire VPN Engine unfortunately is interface-driven and not IP-driven.
As a result, bullets 4 and 5 would never be realized with constant consistentcy.

Bullet 3 case deals with vpn-interface (and so IP Addresses within them) movement across two VPNs, one being
router-vpn and other being the bgpvpn-with-that-router.  And this is extremely slow today and will be unable to
catch up with orchestration of any kind (be it via ODL RPCs) or via Openstack Neutron BGPVPN APIs in a scaled
cloud.

In addition to the above 5 use-cases (which all are driven agnostic to using Neutron Bgpvpn API)
there are specific use-case scenarios which when driven via Openstack Neutron Bgpvpn API
will result in a failures to consistently realize in dataplane, the intended configuration
driven by the orchestrator in the Openstack BGPVPN control plane.

So the initiative of this specification is for improving intrinsic reliability and behavioural consistency within the
L3VPN Engine by enforcing IP Serialization.In addition to that provide a design that can handle faster (but consistent)
movement of IPAddresses between router-vpn and bgpvpn-with-that-router.

Use Case Summary
----------------
All the below use-cases have to be considered with a (3-node Openstack Controller + 3-node ODL cluster).

UC 1: VM Migration (cold migration)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This use-case is to ensure VM Cold Migrations are made robust within L3VPN Engine.
If you notice this mimics a vpninterface moving to different designated location in the cloud.
Has the following sub-cases:
UC 1.1 - Migrate a single dualstack VM residing on a vpn
UC 1.2 - Migrate multiple dualstack VMs residing on different vpns

UC 2: Evacuation of VM (voluntary / involuntary shutdown of the compute host)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This use-case is to ensure VM evacuation cycles are made robust within L3VPN Engine.
This mimics a vpninterface moving to different location in the cloud, but triggered via failing
a compute node.  Has the following sub-cases:
Has the following sub-cases:
UC 2.1 -  Evacuate a single dualstack VM from a single vpn from a compute host
UC 2.2 -  Evacuate multiple dualstack VMs across multiple vpns from the same compute host

UC 3: An Extra-route serviced by one or more VMs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This use-case is to ensure ECMP handling robustness within L3VPN Engine. 
This mimics an ipv4 address being reachable from multiple nexthops (or multiple vpninterfaces).
Has the following sub-cases:
UC 3.1 -  Append a nexthop to an existing IPv4 extra-route
UC 3.2 -  Remove a nexthop from an existing IPv4 extra-route with multiple nexthops
UC 3.3 - Clear away an IPv4 extra-route with multiple nexthops from a router, altogether
UC 3.4 - Delete the VM holding the nexthop of an extra-route
UC 3.5 - Delete a VM and add another new VM holding the same nexthop-ip of an existing extra-route

UC 4: Robust MIP Handling
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This use-case is to ensure VIP/MIP handling robustness within L3VPN Engine.
Has the following sub-cases:
UC 4.1 - Move a MIP from one VM port to another VM port, wherein both the VMs are on the same subnet.
UC 4.2 - When a MIP is shared by two VM ports (active / standby), delete the VM holding the MIP.
UC 4.3 - Migrate a VM which is holding MIP.
UC 4.4 - MIP traffic impact on ODL cluster reboot.
UC 4.5 - MIP traffic impact on OVS disconnect/connect.
UC 4.6 - MIP Aliveness monitoring sessions are not persistent.

UC 5: IP visibility across related VPNs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This use-case is to ensure that ip reachability across two related vpns is made robust within L3VPN Engine.
Has the following sub-cases:
UC 5.1 - Peering VPNs being configured and initiating migration of VMs on one of the peering VPNs
UC 5.2 - Delete peering VPNs simultaneously

In general the above tests sufficiently trigger IP Serialization enforcement and this will enable us
to remove the 2 seconds sleep() from within the ArpProcessingEngine (ArpNotificationHandler).

UC 6: Speed up Router-Association and Router-Disassociation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This use-case is about attempting to speed up the swap of Router into L3VPN and vice-versa.
The idea is to eliminate the 2 seconds sleep present within swap logic, thereby increasing
the rate of servicing vpn-interfaces in the router for the swap cases.


Proposed change
===============
We brainstormed many proposals (or ways) to enforce IP Serialization (within the scope of router / vpn)
and ended up with agreeing with the following proposal.

The proposal chosen was about enforcing IP Serialization by processing all
the VPNs (and then all VPNInterfaces and IPAddresses within them)
in the ODL system through a single node.

Please note that the L3VPN Service consists of the following engines:
* VPNEngine (everything under VpnManager-Api and VpnManager-Impl)
* FIBEngine (everything under FibManager-Api and FibManager-Impl)
* VPNTunnelEngine (TunnelInterfacexxxListener and TEPListener)
* SubnetRouteEngine (VpnSubnetRouteHandler)
* ARPLearningEngine (ArpNotificationHandler and AlivenessMonitor)
All the above engines will be effected/affected as part of implementing following proposals.

Details about the proposal is given below to facilitate implementors.

1. The service name used will be 'L3VPN' and for that service name the VPN-Feature will
   choose a leader node from the 3 nodes in the ODL cluster.  If there is only one node,
   then that node will be considered the leader.

2. How and which node is chosen as a leader will be decoupled from the VPN Engine.
   All the engines within the L3VPN Service will only be consumers of interface exposed by
   a new entity 'VpnLeadershipTracker' ,and this new entity will be responsible to tag
   the leader node by using 'L3VPN' service name as the key.
   While initially we will use cluster-singleton to choose a node as the leader for 'L3VPN'
   service, the tracker will also be expanded as a later review to choose that node which is
   holding the Default Operational Shard as the leader, as #ofreads and #ofwrites to the
   Default Operational Shard is higher by all the engines within the L3VPN Service.

3. A new `VPNEvent` POJO will be made available to store immutable information pertaining to an event of interest
   to the L3VPN service.  This pojo is not a datastore entity and will be constructed dynamically only on the node
   which is the current leader of service name 'L3VPN'.  Also the VPNEvent POJO will contain all the information
   required to process an event by all the engines within the L3VPN service.

4. All along in today's L3VPN Service, the FIBEngine is responsible for processing a VRFEntry creation/deletion/updation.
   Fundamentally, converting an action on a VRFEntry to flow additon/ group addition/ flow removal / group removal is
   driven by FIBEngine (aka VrfEntryListener).
   Going foward, while the FIBEngine will continue to hold this responsibility, the implementation will change the
   lifecycle for VRFEntry handling being triggered synchronously by the VPNEngine instead of asynchronously driven by the FIBEngine.
   This will provide the benefit of passing all the required information synchronously to the methods in the FIBEngine for
   VRFEntry handling by the VPNEngine.  The VRFEntry would become an artifact instead of a trigger source.
   This type of design also enables use of DJC to enforce IP Serialization within a given VPNInstance.
   This change additionally provides elimination of backpulls from the FIBEngine towards VPNEngine and other
   modules for non-BGP-imported-rows   

5. Other than imported BGP routes, all other types of route processing (VM ports, exported VM ports, extra-routes, MIPs), will
   be done in the way quoted in point 4 above.  The BGP imported routes from other neighbours will continue to be
   driven from within the VRFEntryListener.

6. Re-use as much existing handlers within the engines of L3VPN Service in order to contain the robustness effort
   
7. All the VPN Datastores will continued to be made available the same way for other external interfaces and consumers of
   external interfaces to remain unaffected.  Most specifically implementing this area will not effect NATEngine,
   InterVPNLinksEngine and BGPEngine.

8. All BGP Advertisements and Withdrawals (for all routes managed by ODL itself - i.e., non-BGP-imported routes), will be
   done within the VRFEntryListener rather than by the VPN Engine.

9. The VPNInstance creation/deletion/updation handling will be driven on whichever node is the leader
   for 'L3VPN' service as per VpnLeadershipTracker.  The handler for VPNInstance will continue to
   use JobCoordinator keyed on 'VPN-<vpn-name>' to process creation/updation/deletion.

10. The VpnInterface creation/deletion/updation handling will also be driven on whichever node is the leader
    for 'L3VPN' service as per VpnLeadershipTracker.  The following jobKeys for JobCoordinator will be applied
    for VpnInterfaceEvents:
    a. The jobKey of 'vpnid-dpnid' will be used for populateFibOnNewDpn and cleanupFibOnNewDpn (and its related methods)
       Here vpnid is dataplane representation of the VPN (and not the control plane vpnuuid).

    b. b1. The jobKey of 'VPN-<vpn-interface-name>' will continued to be used to serialize all events for a specific vpn-interface.
       b2. Within the 'VPN-<vpn-interface-name>' run, a nested job will be fired with key of 'VPN-rd-prefix' to serialize handler
           run for all IPAddresses within a given vpn (identified by rd). The 'prefix' here can be primary-ip, extra-route-prefix,
           or a discovered mip-prefix.

11. All Along in today's L3VPN Service, VPNEngine is responsible for creating/deleting VRFEntry for MIP and updating the MIP as adjacency
    in config-vpn-interface and operational-vpn-interface.
    Going forward following design changes will be done:
    a. A new MIPEngine will be implemented which will listen on 'MipRouteAdjacency' config container.
       It will persist the MIP IPs learnt through GARP/ARP responses.
       MIPEngine will will be triggered when GARP/ARP Responses arrive and it will create/delete the VRFEntry for MIP.
       MIPEngine will also trigger the Aliveness Manager to start/stop the Monitoring session for each learnt IPs.
       Upon ODL cluster reboot , MIP Engine will trigger the Aliveness Manager to start the monitoring as Aliveness
       Manager does not persist the Monitoring sessions.

    b. Aliveness Manager will be listening on 'Nodes' container to detect OVS connect/disconnect.
       Aliveness Manager will pause the Monitoring session for MIP when OVS disconnects and will resume the Monitoring
       session for MIP when OVS connects.

There are `Thread.sleep` in mulitiple places inside ODL Netvirt projects.  This spec attempts to eliminate the sleep invocations in
the following files:
VpnInterfaceManager  - sleep introduced to allow batch movement of vpn-interfaces from router-to-bgpvpn and vice-versa
ArpNotificationHandler (arpcachetimeout) - The timeout here was actually added to facilitate vpn-lifecycle for a MIP.
NexthopManager - ClusterLock with sleep used to safe management of l3nexthop (createLocalNextHop).

There are still sleeps in other services like Elan, L2Gateway etc and those sleep removals need to be pursued by respective
components.
