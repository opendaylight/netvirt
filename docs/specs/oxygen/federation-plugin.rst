Cross site connectivity with federation service
================================================

https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/#/q/topic:federation-plugin

Enabling neutron networks to expand beyond a single OpenStack instance to allow L2 switching and L3 routing
between sites. Sites may be geographically remote or partitioned in a single data center.

Each site is deployed with independent local ODL cluster. The clusters communicate using the federation
infrastructure [2] in order to publish MDSAL events whenever routable entities e.g. VM instances are added/removed
from remote sites.

VxLAN tunnels are used to form the overlay for cross site communication between OpenStack compute nodes.


Problem description
===================
Today, communication between VMs in remote sites is based on BGP control plane and requires DC-GW.
Overlay network between data centers is based on MPLSoverGRE or VxLAN if the DC-GW supports EVPN RT5 [4].
The purpose of this feature is to allow inter-DC communication independent from BGP control plane and DC-GW.

Use Cases
---------
This feature will cover the following use cases:

L2 switching use cases
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
* L2 Unicast frames exchanged between VMs sharing federated neutron network between OVS datapaths in
  remote sites
* L2 Unicast frames exchanged between VM and PNF sharing federated neutron network between OVS and HWVTEP
  datapath in remote sites
* L2 Broadcast frames exchanged between VMs sharing federated neutron network between OVS datapaths in
  remote sites
* L2 Broadcast frames exchanged between VM and PNF sharing federated neutron network between OVS and HWVTEP
  datapath in remote sites

L3 forwarding use cases
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
* L3 traffic exchanged between VMs sharing federated neutron router between OVS datapaths in
  remote sites


Proposed change
===============
For Carbon release, cross-site connectivity will be based on the current HPE downstream federation plugin codebase.
This plugin implements the federation service API [3] to synchronize the following MDSAL subtrees between connected
sites:

* config/ietf-interfaces:interfaces
* config/elan:elan-interfaces
* config/l3vpn:vpn-interfaces
* config/network-topology:network-topology/topology/ovsdb:1
* operational/network-topology:network-topology/topology/ovsdb:1
* config/network-topology:network-topology/topology/hwvtep:1
* operational/network-topology:network-topology/topology/hwvtep:1
* config/opendaylight-inventory:nodes
* operational/opendaylight-inventory:nodes
* config/neutron:neutron/l2gateways
* config/neutron:neutron/l2gatewayConnections

The provisioning of connected networks between remote sites is out of the scope of this spec and described in [6].

Upon receiving a list of shared neutron networks and subnets, the federation plugin will propagate MDSAL entities from
all of the subtrees detailed above to remote sites based on the federation connection definitions.
The federated entities will be transformed to match the target network/subnet/router details in each remote site.

For example, ELAN interface will be federated with elan-instance-name set to the remote site elan-instance-name.
VPN interface will be federated with the remote site vpn-instance-name i.e. router-id and remote subnet-id contained
in the primary VPN interface adjacency.

This would allow remotely federated entities a.k.a shadow entities to be handled the same way local entities are handled
thus shadow entities will appear as if they were local entities in remote sites.
As a result, the following pipeline elements will be added for shadow entities on all compute nodes in each connected
remote site:

* ELAN remote DMAC flow for L2 unicast packets to remote site
* ELAN remote broadcast group buckets for L2 multicast packets to remote site
* FIB remote nexthop flow for L3 packet to remote site

The following limitations exist for the current federation plugin implementation:

* Federated networks use VxLAN network type and the same VNI is used across sites.
* The IP addresses allocated to VM instances in federated subnets do not overlap across sites.
* The neutron-configured VNI will be passed on the wire for inter-DC L2/L3 communication between VxLAN networks.
  The implementation is described in [5].


As part of Nitrogen, the federation plugin is planned to go through major redesign. The scope and internals have not
been finalized yet but this spec might be a good opportunity to agree on an alternate solution.

Some initial thoughts:

* For L3 cross site connectivity, it seems that federating the FIB vrf-entry associated with VMs in connected
  networks should be sufficient to form remote nexthop connectivity across sites.
* In order to create VxLAN tunnels to remote sites, it may be possible to use the external tunnel concept instead
  of creating internal tunnels that are dependent on federation of the OVS topology nodes from remote sites.
* L2 cross site connectivity is the most challenging part for federation of MAC addresses of both VM
  instances and PNFs connected to HWVTEP.
  If the ELAN model could be enhanced to have remote-mac-entry model containing MAC address, ELAN instance name
  and remote TEP ip, it would be possible to federate such entity to remote sites in order to create remote DMAC
  flows for cases of remote VM instances and PNFs connected HWVTEP in remote sites.


Pipeline changes
----------------
No new pipeline changes are introduced as part of this feature. The pipeline flow between VM instances in
remote sites is similar to the current implementation of cross compute intra-DC traffic since the
realization of remote compute nodes is similar to local ones.

Yang changes
------------
The following new yang models will be introduced as part of the federation plugin API bundle:

Work Items
----------
Trello card https://trello.com/c/mgdUO6xx/154-federation-plugin-for-netvirt

Since the code was already implemented in downstream no work items will be defined

Dependencies
============
This feature will be implemented in 2 new bundles - ``federation-plugin-api`` and ``federation-plugin-impl``
the implementation will be dependent on ``federation-service-api`` [3] bundle from OpenDaylight federation project.

The new karaf feature ``odl-netvirt-federation`` will encapsulate the federation-plugin api and impl bundles
and will be dependant on the followings features:

* ``federation-with-rabbit`` from federation project
* ``odl-netvirt-openstack`` from netvirt project


Testing
=======

Unit Tests
----------
End-to-end component service will test the federation plugin on top of the federation service.

Integration Tests
-----------------
None

CSIT
----
The CSIT infrastructure will be enhanced to support connect/disconnect operations between sites using
update-federated-networks RPC call.

A new federation suite will test L2 and L3 connectivity between remote sites and will be based on the
existing L2/L3 connectivity suites.
CSIT will load sites A,B and C in 1-node/3-node deployment options to run the following tests:

1 Install odl-netvirt-federation feature
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Basic L2 connectivity test within the site
* Basic L3 connectivity test within the site
* L2 connectivity between sites - expected to fail since sites are not connected
* L3 connectivity between sites - expected to fail since sites are not connected

2 Connect sites A,B
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Basic L2 connectivity test within the site
* L2 connectivity test between VMs in sites A,B
* L2 connectivity test between VMs in sites A,C and B,C - expected to fail since sites are not connected
* Basic L3 connectivity test within the site
* L3 connectivity test between VMs in sites A,B
* L3 connectivity test between VMs in sites A,C and B,C - expected to fail since sites are not connected

3 Connect site C to A,B
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* L2 connectivity test between VMs in sites A,B B,C and A,C
* L3 connectivity test between VMs in sites A,B B,C and A,C
* Connectivity test between VMs in non-federated networks in sites A,B,C - expected to fail

4 Disconnect site C from A,B
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Repeat the test steps from 2 after C disconnect. Identical results expected.

5 Disconnect sites A,B
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Repeat the test steps from 1 after A,B disconnect. Identical results expected.

6 Federation cluster test
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Repeat test steps 1-5 while rebooting the ODLs between the steps similarly to the existing cluster suite.
