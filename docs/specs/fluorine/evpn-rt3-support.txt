Support for RT3 route type in EVPN
=========================================================

https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/#/q/topic:EVPN_RT3

Enable support for RT3 route type in evpn deployment.

Problem description
===================

OpenDaylight NetVirt service today supports EVPN over VXLAN tunnels.
L2DCI communication was made possible with this.

This spec attempts to enhance EVPN service in NetVirt to add support for RT3 route type.

Type 3 routes are required for Broadcast, Unknown Unicast and Multicast (BUM) traffic delivery across EVPN networks.
Type 3 advertisements provide information that should be used to send BUM traffic.
Without Type 3 advertisements, ingress router would not know how to deliver BUM traffic to other PE devices that comprise given EVPN instance.

The format of Type 3 advertisement is as follows

               +---------------------------------------+
               |  RD (8 octets)                        |
               +---------------------------------------+
               |  Ethernet Tag ID (4 octets)           |
               +---------------------------------------+
               |  IP Address Length (1 octet)          |
               +---------------------------------------+
               |  Originating Router's IP Address      |
               |          (4 or 16 octets)             |
               +---------------------------------------+

               
In scope
--------

Only ingress replication mode will be supported for now.

Out of scope
------------

Use Cases
---------

All the use cases supported by RT2 feauture will be supported.

Proposed change
===============

Pipeline changes
----------------
No Pipeline changes are required.

Yang changes
------------
There are no yang changes required.

The list ``external-teps`` is updated in elan container every time an RT3 route is received/withdrawn.

.. code-block:: none
   :caption: elan.yang

    container elan-instances {
        list elan-instance {
            key "elan-instance-name";
            leaf elan-instance-name {
                type string;
            }
            //omitted other existing fields
            list external-teps {
                key tep-ip;
                leaf tep-ip {
                    type inet:ip-address;
                }
            }
        }
    }

Solution considerations
-----------------------

Proposed change in BGP Quagga Stack
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The following thrift apis would be added to communicate to quagga.

.. code-block:: none
   :caption: elan.yang

    pushEvpnRT(EvpnConfigData evpnConfig)
    onupdatePushEvpnRT(EvpnConfigData evpnConfig)

    EvpnConfigData evpnConfig {
        1: required byte evpnConfigDataVersion = 1;
        2: required byte  routeType;
        3: required string rd;
        4: required long ethTag;
        5: required string esi;
        6: required byte tunnelType;
        7: required string tunnelId;
        8: required i32 label;
    }

Proposed change in OpenDaylight-specific features
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The following components within OpenDaylight Controller needs to be enhanced:

* ELAN Manager
* BGP Manager

Reboot Scenarios
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This feature support all the following Reboot Scenarios for EVPN:

*  Entire Cluster Reboot
*  Leader PL reboot
*  Candidate PL reboot
*  OVS Datapath reboots
*  Multiple PL reboots
*  Multiple Cluster reboots
*  Multiple reboots of the same OVS Datapath.
*  Openstack Controller reboots


Configuration impact
--------------------
N.A.

Clustering considerations
-------------------------
The feature should operate in ODL Clustered environment reliably.

Other Infra considerations
--------------------------
N.A.

Security considerations
-----------------------
N.A.

Scale and Performance Impact
----------------------------
Not covered by this Design Document.

Targeted Release
----------------
Fluronie.

Alternatives
------------
Alternatives considered and why they were not selected.

Usage
=====

Features to Install
-------------------
This feature can be used by installing odl-netvirt-openstack.
This feature doesn't add any new karaf feature.

  Vyshakh Krishnan C H <vyshakh.krishnan.c.h@ericsson.com>


Work Items
----------
Trello card details TODO

Dependencies
============
Requires a DC-GW that is supporting EVPN RT3 on BGP Control plane.

Testing
=======
Capture details of testing that will need to be added.

Unit Tests
----------
Appropriate UTs will be added for the new code.

Integration Tests
-----------------
There won't be any Integration tests provided for this feature.

CSIT
----
CSIT will be enhanced to cover this feature by providing new CSIT tests.

1) advertize RT3 route from dcgw , verify that remote broad cast group on all computes which host that network is updated to include the dcgw nexthop.
2) withdraw RT3 route from dcgw , verify that remote broad cast group on all computes which host that network is updated to exclude the dcgw nexthop.
3) bring up first elan vm on a compute, verify that RT3 route is advertized.
4) bring up second elan vm on the same compute, verify that RT3 route is not advertized again.
5) bring down first elan vm on a compute, verify that RT3 route is not withdrawn.
6) bring down last elan vm on a compute, verify that RT3 route is withdrawn.
7) Disassociate network from evpn, verify that all computes broadcasts are updated to exclude the dcgw nexthops.


Documentation Impact
====================
This will require changes to User Guide and Developer Guide.
