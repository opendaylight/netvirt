Support for RT3 route type in EVPN
=========================================================

https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/#/q/topic:EVPN_RT3

Enable support for RT3 route type in evpn deployment.

Problem description
===================

OpenDaylight NetVirt service today supports EVPN over VXLAN tunnels.
L2DCI communication was made possible with this.

This spec attempts to enhance EVPN service in NetVirt by adding support for RT3 route type.

Type 3 routes are required for Broadcast, Unknown Unicast and Multicast (BUM) traffic delivery across EVPN networks.
Type 3 advertisements provide information that should be used to send BUM traffic.
Without Type 3 advertisements, ingress router would not know how to deliver BUM traffic to other PE devices that comprise given EVPN instance.
Today BUM traffic is sent to all the datacenter gateways from which RT2 is received.
Suppose there is a silent host behind a datacenter gateway, BUM traffic is never sent to that host.
e.g: ODL is connected to 2 - Gateway1 and Gateway2. VM1 and VM2 is booted in Gateway1 and suppose a silent host H1 resides behind Gateway2.
For VM1 and VM2 RT2 would be received in the ODL and BUM traffic from ODL orchestrated VM- VMx would only reach VM1 and VM2.
H1 being part of the same EVPN instance would never recieve traffic from VMx.


The format of Type 3 advertisement is as follows

               +---------------------------------------+
               |  Route Distinguisher (8 octets)       |
               +---------------------------------------+
               |  Ethernet Tag ID (4 octets)           |
               +---------------------------------------+
               |  IP Address Length (1 octet)          |
               +---------------------------------------+
               |  Originating Router's IP Address      |
               |          (4 or 16 octets)             |
               +---------------------------------------+

Type 3 route also carries a Provider Multicast Service Interface (PMSI) Tunnel attribute.

               +---------------------------------------+
               |  Flags (1 octet)                      |
               +---------------------------------------+
               |  Tunnel Type (1 octets)               |
               +---------------------------------------+
               |  MPLS Label (3 octets)                |
               +---------------------------------------+
               |  Tunnel Identifier (variable)         |
               +---------------------------------------+

      The following are the Tunnel Types:

      + 0 - No tunnel information present
      + 1 - RSVP-TE P2MP LSP
      + 2 - mLDP P2MP LSP
      + 3 - PIM-SSM Tree
      + 4 - PIM-SM Tree
      + 5 - BIDIR-PIM Tree
      + 6 - Ingress Replication
      + 7 - mLDP MP2MP LSP

In scope
--------

Only Ingress Replication tunnel type will be supported for now.
MPLS Lable and Tunnel Identifier present in the received RT3 route will be ignored.

While advertizing MPLS Lable and Tunnel Identifier will be set to a value of zero.
While sending BUM traffic l2vni of the vpn instance is used in the vxlan packet.

Supports both ipv4 and ipv6 for Originating Router's IP Address field.

Out of scope
------------

Tunnel types other than Ingress Replication will be ignored.

Use Cases
---------

All the use cases supported by RT2 feauture will be supported.

Proposed change
===============

Pipeline changes
----------------
No Pipeline changes are required.

Yang changes
------------
There are no yang changes required.

The list ``external-teps`` is updated in elan container every time an RT3 route is received/withdrawn.

.. code-block:: none
   :caption: elan.yang

    container elan-instances {
        list elan-instance {
            key "elan-instance-name";
            leaf elan-instance-name {
                type string;
            }
            //omitted other existing fields
            list external-teps {
                key tep-ip;
                leaf tep-ip {
                    type inet:ip-address;
                }
            }
        }
    }

Solution considerations
-----------------------

Proposed change in BGP Quagga Stack
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The following thrift apis would be added to communicate to quagga.

.. code-block:: none
   :caption: elan.yang

    pushEvpnRT(EvpnConfigData evpnConfig)
    onupdatePushEvpnRT(EvpnConfigData evpnConfig)

    EvpnConfigData evpnConfig {
        1: required byte evpnConfigDataVersion = 1;
        2: required byte  routeType;
        3: required string rd;
        4: required long ethTag;
        5: required string esi;
        6: required byte tunnelType;
        7: required string tunnelId;
        8: required i32 label;
    }

Proposed change in OpenDaylight-specific features
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The following components within OpenDaylight Controller needs to be enhanced:

* ELAN Manager
* BGP Manager

Upon receiving the RT3 route, the elan instance associated to the evpn instance is identified.
On that particular elan instance, external tep-ips field is added with the value of Originating Router's IP Address.
This external tep-ips list is used for constructing the elan broadcast group.

The following actions will be performed against each step in the orchestration.
1) create evpn1, evpn2 instances.
2) associate network1 with evpn1 instance and network2 with evpn2.
3) spawn network1_vm1 on compute1. At this step RT3 route is advertized with the tep ip of compute1 (using rd of evpn1).
4) spawn network1_vm2 on compute1. No RT3 route needs to be advertized for compute1 as it is already done in step1.
5) spawn network1_vm3 on compute2. At this step RT3 route is advertized with the tep ip of compute2.
6) spawn network1_vm4 on compute1. No RT3 route needs to be advertized for compute2.

7) spawn network2_vm1 on compute1. At this step RT3 route is advertized with the tep ip of compute1 (using rd of evpn2).
8) spawn network2_vm2 on compute1. No RT3 route needs to be advertized for compute1.
9) spawn network2_vm3 on compute2. At this step RT3 route is advertized with the tep ip of compute2.
10) spawn network2_vm4 on compute1. No RT3 route needs to be advertized for compute2.

11) delete network1_vm1 from compute1. No action taken as compute1 still has a vm from network1 (network1_vm2)
12) delete network1_vm2 from compute1. Send withdraw RT3 route using rd of evpn1 and compute1 tep.
13) delete network2_vm1 from compute1. No action taken as compute1 still has a vm from network1 (network2_vm2)
14) delete network2_vm2 from compute1. Send withdraw RT3 route using rd of evpn2 and compute1 tep.
