Conntrack Based SNAT
====================

https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/#/q/topic:snat_conntrack

The ovs conntrack based SNAT implements Source Network Address Translation using openflow rules by
leveraging ovs-netfilter integration.

Problem description
===================

Today SNAT is done in Opendaylight netvirt using controller punting and thus controller installing
the rules for inbound and outbound NAPT. This causes significant delay as the first packet of all
the new connections needs to go through the controller.The number of flows grows linearly with the
increase in the vms. Also the current implementation does not support ICMP.

Use Cases
---------
The following use case will be realized by the implementation

External Network Access
The SNAT enables the VM in a tenant network access the external network without using a floating ip. It
uses NAPT for sharing the external ip address across multiple VMs that share the same router
gateway.

Proposed change
===============

The proposed implementation uses linux netfilter framework to do the NAPT (Network Address Port
Translation) and for tracking the connection. The first packet of  a traffic will be committed to
the netfilter for translation along with the external ip. The subsequent packets will use the entry
in the netfilter for inbound and outbound translation. The router id will be used as the zone id in
the netfilter. Each zone tracks the connection in its own table. The rest of the implementation for
selecting the designated NAPT switch and non designated switches will remain the same. The pipeline
changes will happen in the designated switch. With this implementation we will be able to do
translation for icmp as well.

The openflow plugin needs to support new set of actions for conntrack based NAPT. This shall be
added in the nicira plugin extension of OpenFlow plugin.

The new implementation will not re-install the existing NAT entries to the new NAPT switch during
fail-over.  Also spec does not cover the use case of having multiple external subnets in the same
router.

Pipeline changes
----------------
The ovs based NAPT flows will replace the controller based NAPT flows. The changes are limited
to the designated switch for the router. The NAPT INBOUND Table is changed from table 44 to 43
for both the implementation. Below is the illustration for flat external network.

Outbound NAPT

Table 26 (PSNAT Table)  => submits the packet to netfilter to check whether it is an existing
connection. Resubmits the packet back to 46.

Table 44 => The metadata will be swapped here to that of the external network and packet will
be send to table 47.

Table 46 (NAPT OUTBOUND TABLE) => if it is an established connection which indicates the
translation is done and the packet is forwarded to table 44.
If it is a new connection the connection will be committed to netfilter and this entry will be
used for napt. The translated packet will be resubmitted to table 44.

Table 47 (NAPT FIB TABLE) => The translated packet will be sent to the egress group.

Sample Flows

::

 table=26, priority=5,ip,metadata=0x222e2/0xfffffffe actions=ct(table=46,zone=5003,nat)
 table=44, priority=5,ct_state=+snat,ip,metadata=0x222e2/0xfffffffe,nw_src=192.168.111.21 actions=write_metadata:0x222e0/0xfffffffe,goto_table:47
 table=46, priority=6,ct_state=+snat,ip actions=resubmit(,44)
 table=46, priority=5,ct_state=+new+trk,ip,metadata=0x222e2/0xfffffffe actions=ct(commit,table=44,zone=5003,nat(src=192.168.111.21))
 table=47, priority=6,ct_state=+snat,ip,nw_src=192.168.111.21 actions=group:200003

Inbound NAPT

Table 43 (NAPT INBOUND Table)=> submits the packet to netfilter to check for an existing
connection. The packet will be submitted back to table 44.

Table 44 => The metadata will be swapped here to that of the internal network and packet will
be send to table 47.

Table 47 (NAPT FIB TABLE) => The translated packet will be sent to table 43 for writing the
appropriate metadata and will be submitted back to table 21.

Sample Flows

::

 table=21, priority=42,ip,metadata=0x222e0/0xfffffffe,nw_dst=192.168.111.21 actions=resubmit(,43)
 table=43, priority=10,ip actions=ct(table=44,zone=5003,nat)
 table=44, priority=5,ct_state=+dnat,ip,metadata=0x222e0/0xfffffffe actions=write_metadata:0x222e2/0xfffffffe,goto_table:47
 table=47, priority=5,ct_state=+dnat,ip actions=resubmit(,21)

Yang changes
------------
The nicira-action.yang and the openflowplugin-extension-nicira-action.yang needs to be updated
with nat action. The action structure shall be

Configuration impact
--------------------
The proposed change requires the NAT service to provide a configuration knob to switch between the
controller based/conntrack based implementation. A new configuration file shall be added for this.

Clustering considerations
-------------------------
NA

Other Infra considerations
--------------------------
The implementation requires ovs2.6 with the kernel module installed. OVS currently does not support
SNAT connection tracking for dpdk datapath. It would be supported in some future release.

Security considerations
-----------------------
NA

Scale and Performance Impact
----------------------------
The new SNAT implementation is expected to improve the performance when compared to the existing
one and will reduce the flows in ovs pipeline.

Targeted Release
----------------
Carbon

Alternatives
------------
An alternative implementation of X NAPT switches was discussed, which will not be a part of this
document but will be considered as a further enhancement.
