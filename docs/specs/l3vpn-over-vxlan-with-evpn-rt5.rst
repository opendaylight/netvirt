=======================================================
Support of VXLAN based connectivity across Datacenters
=======================================================

**Important: All gerrit links that is raised for this feature must have topic name as "EVPN_RT5"**

This feature is to study the realization aspects of L3 connectivity using L3 BGPVPNs (by using EVPN as the BGP Control Plane mechanism)
which are orchestrated through OpenStack/Neutron and ODL RESTful APIs. The scope primarily includes providing ability to support:

a.    Intra-subnet connectivity within DC over VXLAN tunnels.
b.    Inter-subnet connectivity within DC over VXLAN tunnels.
c.    Inter-subnet connectivity across DCs over VXLAN tunnels.

This Design doc does not cover intra-subnet connectivity across DCs.

For more details on please refer [1] [2] and [3].
Phase 2 will have a separate Design Document and that will cover intra-subnet inter-DC as the primary use-case and it will use RT2 as
the advertisement type to accomplish the same.


Problem description
===================

**A. In Scope:**

    1.	Enable creation, deletion, updation (i.e., management) of BGP L3VPN (EVPN) with an L3VNI in the ODL NetVirt BGPVPN Implementation.
    2.  Provide intra-subnet connectivity between workloads (Virtual Machines) within a DataCenter (DC) for L3VPN (with L3VNI) by using
        the same way as it is managed today (using LPortTags instead of Openstack supplied VNIs).
    3.	Provide inter-subnet connectivity between workloads (Virtual Machines) within a DataCenter (DC) using L3VPN forwarding (but will
        use LPortTags instead of MPLS Labels since the transport plane is VXLAN).
    4.	Provide inter-subnet connectivity between workloads (Virtual Machines) across DataCenters by using L3VPN that internally uses EVPN
        RT5 in the BGP Control Plane.
    5.  Test with DC-GW to validate inter-DC L3 connectivity.
    6.  Support Import / Export RT BGP facility for L3VPN instances (with L3VNI available).
    7.  Support External Network Connectivity from within DC using SNAT / DNAT for ‘Internet VPN’ that is L3VPN-based.
    8.  Support Subnet Route driven connectivity from VPN Sites to Enterprise networks (via DC) over EVPN.


**B. Not in Scope**

    a.  Intra-subnet connectivity across DCs as this requires RT2 implementation.
    b.  Underlay configuration and any special control mechanisms for TORs
    c.  QoS, traffic policing for L3VPN instances
    d.  Service chaining and other Openflow based features for L3VPN Instances

Use Cases
---------

The following use-cases will be realized by this Implementation Sketch. Wherever CSC is mentioned it refers to an ODL Controller Cluster.

**A. DC Access**

This use case involves EVPN/VXLAN to IP-VPN interworking and this requires only L3 gateway functions are needed. L3 prefixes are
exchanged with EVPN RT5 and data-plane will be VxLAN. These use cases are very similar to existing L3VPN service functions in CSC (ODL).
However, in place of BGP VPNv4, it will use EVPN RT-5 for IP-prefix advertisement and the overlay transport will be VxLAN based.

    **A.1 Use Case 1.1: DC-access L3Gateway Single Homing**
    This use case involves EVPN/VXLAN to IP-VPN interworking for L3 connectivity between DC Fabric and WAN with single DCGW acting as ASBR[AKMA1] [NV2] .

      · This use case will have single DCGW for WAN connectivity
      · IP prefix exchange between CSC and DCGW (iBGP) using EVPN RT5.
      · WAN control plane will use L3VPN route exchange
      · On DCGW, the VRF instance configured with two sets of import/export targets, one set of import/export route targets belong to EVPN in DC and the second set of import/export route target belongs to WAN control plane.
      · EVPN single homing, ESI=0 for all prefixes generated from DC
      · Inter AS option B is used at DCGW, route regeneration at DCGW

**B. L3 DCI**

    **B.1 Use Case 1.2: L3DCI with DC EVPN VXLAN and IP-MPLS L3VPN in WAN using single DCGW** [AKMA3] [NV4]

    In scenarios where DCGW only support EVPN RT5 (as is the current capability of Cisco ASR9000), only L3 gateway functions are possible.
    This use case is very much same as UC1.1, however in place of Client DC access, it targets L3 DCI.

    **B.2 Use Case 1.3: L3 DCI with EVPN IP-MPLS in WAN using single DCGW**
    This use case is very much same as UC1.2, however in place of L3VPN in WAN there will be EVPN control plane in WAN.
    EVPN RT-5 will be used in WAN for route exchange.


Proposed change
===============

The following components within OpenDaylight Controller needs to be enhanced:
a.	NeutronvpnManager
b.	VPN Engine (VPN Manager and VPN Interface Manager)
c. 	FIB Manager
d.	BGP Manager
e.	VPN SubnetRoute Handler
f.  NAT Service

Pipeline changes
----------------
There are no explicit pipeline changes, however rules in the existing ODL pipeline will be configured for EVPN interfaces differently.

**1.1.1 INTRA DC:**
**Intra Subnet, Local DPN:**  VMs on the same subnet, same VPN, same DPN
TABLE 0 => DISPATCHER TABLE => MY-MAC-TABLE => DISPATCHER TABLE => SMAC TABLE => DMAC TABLE => Output to destination VM port


**Intra Subnet, Remote DPN:**  VMs on two different DPNs, both VMs on the same subnet and same VPN.
a.    VM sourcing the traffic (Ingress DPN)
TABLE 0 => DISPATCHER TABLE => MY MAC TABLE => DISPATCHER TABLE => SMAC TABLE => DMAC TABLE => Set Tunnel ID (LPORT TAG) => Output to Tunnel port
b.    VM receiving the traffic (Egress DPN)
TABLE 0 => TERMINATING SERVICE TABLE (match LPORT TAG) => Output to destination VM port


**Inter Subnet, Local DPN:** VMs on different subnet, same VPN, same DPN
TABLE 0 => DISPATCHER TABLE => MY MAC TABLE (match routerMAC) => FIB TABLE => Output to NextHop Group for destination VM.[AKMA5] [NV6]


**Inter Subnet, Remote DPN:**  VMs on two different DPNs, both VMs on different subnet, but same VPN.
a.    VM sourcing the traffic (Ingress DPN)
TABLE 0 => DISPATCHER TABLE => MY MAC TABLE (match routerMAC) => FIB TABLE => (SET DESTINATION MAC ADDRESS à SET Tunnel ID (LPORT TAG) à Output to Internal Tunnel port
b.    VM receiving the traffic (Egress DPN)
TABLE 0 => TERMINATING SERVICE TABLE (match LPORT TAG) => Output to destination VM port

**1.1.2 INTER DC:**

**Intra Subnet**
Not supported in this Phase

**Inter Subnet**
Traffic from DC-Gateway to Local DPN (SYMMETRIC IRB):
TABLE 0 => DISPATCHER TABLE => EXTERNAL_TUNNEL_TABLE => MY MAC TABLE (matching routerMAC) => FIB TABLE => Output to NextHop Group for Destination VM

Traffic from Local DPN to DC-Gateway (SYMMETRIC IRB):
TABLE 0-> DISPATCHER TABLE => MY MAC TABLE (matching routerMAC) => FIB TABLE => SET TUNNEL ID (VNI) à Output to EXTERNAL VXLAN Tunnel Port (add the inner Dst MAC Address)
