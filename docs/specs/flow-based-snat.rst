Flow Based SNAT
===============

https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/#/q/topic:snat_cnntrk

The ovs flow based SNAT implements Source Network Address Translation using openflow rules by
leveraging ovs-netfilter integration.

Problem description
===================

Today SNAT is done in Opendaylight netvirt using controller punting and thus controller installing
the rules for inbound and outbound NAPT. This causes significant delay as the first packet of all
the new connection needs to go through the controller.The number of flows grows linearly with the
increase in the vm. The current implementation does not support ICMP.

Use Cases
---------
The following use case will be realized by the implementation

External Network Access
The SNAT enables the vm inside the DC to the external world without using a floating ip. It uses
NAPT for sharing the external ip address across the vm

Proposed change
===============

The proposed implementation makes uses linux netfilter framework do the NAPT and for tracking the
connection. The first packet of  a traffic will be committed to the netfilter for translation along
with the external ip for translation.  The subsequent packets will use the entry in the netfilter
for inbound and outbound translation. The router id will be used as the zone id in the netfilter.
Each zone tracks the connection in its own table. The rest of the implementation for selecting
the designated NAPT switch and non designated switches will remain the same. The pipeline changes
will happen in the designated switch.

The openflow plugin needs to support new set of action for flow based NAPT. This shall be added in
the nicira plugin extension of OpenFlow plugin.

Pipeline changes
----------------
The ovs based NAPT flows will replace the controller based NAPT flows. It reuses the existing
tables, the changes are limited to the designated switch for the router.

Outbound NAPT
-------------
Table 26  => submits the packet to netfilter to check whether it is an existing connection.
Resubmits the packet back to 46.

Table 46 => if it is an established connection which indicates the translation is done and the
packet is forwarded to table 47.
If it is a new connection the connection will be committed to netfilter and this entry will be
used for napt. The translated packet will be resubmitted to table 47.

Sample Flows

table=26,priority=5,ip,metadata=0x222e0/0xfffffffe action=ct'('table=46,zone=1,nat')'
table=46,priority=5,ct_state=+trk+est,metadata=0x222e0/0xfffffffe,ip,action=write_metadata:0x222e0/0xfffffffe,goto_table:47
table=46,priority=5,ip,ct_state=+trk+new,metadata=metadata=0x222e0/0xfffffffe,actions=write_metadata:0x222e0/0xfffffffe,ct'('commit,zone=1,nat'('src=192.168.56.9-192.168.56.9'))',ct'('table=47,zone=1,nat')â€™

Inbound NAPT
------------
Table 21 => submits the packet to netfilter to check for an existing connection. The packet
will be submitted back to table 44.
Table 44 =>writes the appropriate metadata to the translated packet and submits the submit the
packet to table 47.

Sample Flows

table=21,priority=5,ip,metadata=0x222e0/0xfffffffe,nw_dst=192.168.56.9,actions=ct'('table=44,zone=1,nat')'
table=44,priority=5,ip,metadata=0x222e0/0xfffffffe,nw_dst=10.100.5.3,actions=write_metadata:0x222e2/0xfffffffe,goto_table:47

Yang changes
------------
The nicira-action.yang and the openflowplugin-extension-nicira-action.yang needs to be updated
with nat action. The action structure shall be

container nx-action-nat {
            leaf flags {
                type uint16;
            }
            leaf ip-address-min {
                type inet:ip-address;
            }
            leaf ip-address-max {
                type inet:ip-address;
            }
        }

Configuration impact
--------------------
The proposed change requires the NAT service to provide a configuration knob to switch between the
controller based/flow based implementation. A new configuration file shall be added for this.

Clustering considerations
-------------------------
This should capture how clustering will be supported. This can include but
not limited to use of CDTCL, EOS, Cluster Singleton etc.

Other Infra considerations
--------------------------
This should capture impact from/to different infra components like
MDSAL Datastore, karaf, AAA etc.

Security considerations
-----------------------
Document any security related issues impacted by this feature.

Scale and Performance Impact
----------------------------
The new SNAT implementation is expected to improve the performance when compared to the existing
one and will reduce the flows in ovs pipeline.

Targeted Release
----------------
Carbon

Alternatives
------------
The idea of decentralized SNAT was considered where a ip address will be assigned per compute for
an external router interface per tenant. But was put on hold considering the scarcity of external
IP address.

An alternative of X NAPT switches was discussed, which will not be a part of this document but will
be considered as a further enhancement.

Usage
=====
How will end user use this feature? Primary focus here is how this feature
will be used in an actual deployment.

e.g. For most netvirt features this will include OpenStack APIs.

This section will be primary input for Test and Documentation teams.
Along with above this should also capture REST API and CLI.

Features to Install
-------------------
odl-netvirt-openstack

Identify existing karaf feature to which this change applies and/or new karaf
features being introduced. These can be user facing features which are added
to integration/distribution or internal features to be used by other projects.

REST API
--------
Sample JSONS/URIs. These will be an offshoot of yang changes. Capture
these for User Guide, CSIT, etc.

CLI
---
Any CLI if being added.

Implementation
==============

Assignee(s)
-----------
Who is implementing this feature? In case of multiple authors, designate a
primary assigne and other contributors.

Primary assignee:
  <developer-a>

Other contributors:
  <developer-b>

Work Items
----------
Break up work into individual items. This should be a checklist on
Trello card for this feature. Give link to trello card or duplicate it.

Dependencies
============

Any dependencies being added/removed? Dependencies here refers to internal
[other ODL projects] as well as external [OVS, karaf, JDK etc.] This should
also capture specific versions if any of these dependencies.
e.g. OVS version, Linux kernel version, JDK etc.

This should also capture impacts on existing project that depend on Netvirt.

Following projects currently depend on Netvirt:
 Unimgr

Testing
=======
Capture details of testing that will need to be added.

Unit Tests
----------

Documentation Impact
====================
What is impact on documentation for this change? If documentation
change is needed call out one of the <contributors> who will work with
Project Documentation Lead to get the changes done.

Don't repeat details already discussed but do reference and call them out.
