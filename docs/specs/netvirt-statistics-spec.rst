   Key points to consider:
  * Use RST format. For help with syntax refer http://sphinx-doc.org/rest.html
  * Use http://rst.ninjs.org/ a web based WYSIWYG RST editor.
  * For diagrams, you can use http://asciiflow.com to make ascii diagrams.
  * MUST READ http://docs.opendaylight.org/en/latest/documentation.html and follow guidelines.
  * Use same topic branch name for all patches related to this feature.
  * All sections should be retained, but can be marked None or N.A.
  * Set depth in ToC as per your doc requirements. Should be at least 2.

=====================
Netvirt Statistics
=====================

https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/#/c/50164/

The feature enables getting statistics on ports and switches.


Problem description
===================

Being able to ask for statistics, given as input Netvirt identifiers. It will enable filtering the results and having aggregated result. In a later stage, it will be also used to get element to element counters.
Examples for possible filters: RX only, TX only, port + VLAN counters...

Use Cases
---------

* Getting port counters, given its interface id (will also be used for tunnel counters).
* Getting node counters, given its node id.

Proposed change
===============

Adding a new bundle named "statistics-plugin" to Netvirt. This bundle will be responsible for converting the Netvirt unique identifiers into OpenFlow ones, and will get the relevant statistics by using OpenFlowPlugin capabilities. It will also be responsible of validating and filtering the results. It will be able to provide a wide range of aggregated results in the future.

The new plugin introduced will have the following models:
::

    grouping result {
            list groups {
                key name;
                leaf name {
                    type string;
                }
                list counters {
                    key name;
                    leaf id {
                        type string;
                    }
                    leaf value {
                        type uint64;
                    }
                }
            }
    }

    grouping filters{
            leaf-list groupFilters {
                type string;
            }
            leaf-list counterFilter {
                type string;
            }
    }

    rpc getPortCounters {
        input {
            leaf portId {
                type string;
            }
            uses filters;
        }
        output {
                uses result;
        }
    }

    rpc getNodeCounters {
        input {
            leaf nodeId {
                type string;
                }
            }
        output {
                uses filters;
        }
    }

Usage
=====
* Create router, network, VMS, VXLAN tunnel.
* Connect to one of the VMs, send ping ping to the other VM.
* Use REST to get the statistics.

Port statistics:

::

    http://10.0.77.135:8181/restconf/operational/ietf-interfaces:interfaces-state/

Choose a port id and use the following REST in order to get the statistics:

::

    10.0.77.135:8181/restconf/operations/statistics-plugin:getPortCounters, input={"input": {"portId":"b99a7352-1847-4185-ba24-9ecb4c1793d9"}}, headers={Authorization=Basic YWRtaW46YWRtaW4=, Cache-Control=no-cache, Content-Type=application/json}]


Node statistics:

::

    http://10.0.77.135:8181/restconf/config/odl-interface-meta:bridge-interface-info/

Choose a node uuid and use the following REST in order to get the statistics:

::

    10.0.77.135:8181/restconf/operations/statistics-plugin:getNodeCounters, input= 
           {"input": { "portId": "b99a7352-1847-4185-ba24-9ecb4c1793d9","groups": [{ "name": "IN_*",
                                "counters": [{
                                                                "name": "duration*",
                                                        }, {
                                                                "name": "byte*",
                                                        }]
                                        }]
            }}, 
    headers={Authorization=Basic YWRtaW46YWRtaW4=, Cache-Control=no-cache, Content-Type=application/json}]

Example for a filtered request:

::

    10.0.77.135:8181/restconf/operations/statistics-plugin:getPortCounters, input={"input": {"portId":"b99a7352-1847-4185-ba24-9ecb4c1793d9"} }, headers={Authorization=Basic YWRtaW46YWRtaW4=, Cache-Control=no-cache, Content-Type=application/json}]
