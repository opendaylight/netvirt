Support of VXLAN based L2 connectivity across Datacenters
=======================================================

https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/#/q/topic:EVPN_RT2

Enable realization of L2 connectivity over VXLAN tunnels using L3 BGPVPNs,
internally taking advantage of EVPN as the BGP Control Plane mechanism.

Problem description
===================

OpenDaylight NetVirt service today supports VLAN-based,
VXLAN-based connectivity and MPLSOverGRE-based overlays.

In this VXLAN-based underlay is supported only for traffic
within the DataCenter.   For all the traffic that need to
go via the DC-Gateway the only supported underlay is MPLSOverGRE.

Though there is a way to provision an external VXLAN tunnel
via the ITM service in Genius, the BGPVPN service in
NetVirt does not have the ability to take advantage of such
a tunnel to provide inter-DC connectivity.

This spec attempts to enhance the BGPVPN service (runs on
top of the current L3 Forwarding service) in NetVirt to
embrace inter-DC L3 connectivity over external VXLAN tunnels.

In scope
---------

The scope primarily includes providing ability to support intra-subnet
connectivity across DataCenters over VXLAN tunnels by modeling a
new type of L3VPN which will realize this connectivity using
EVPN BGP Control plane semantics.

When we mention that we are using EVPN BGP Control plane, this
spec proposes using the RouteType 2 as the primary
means to provision the control plane en enable inter-DC connectivity
over external VXLAN tunnels.

With this inplace we will be able to support all the following.

* Intra-subnet connectivity within a DataCenter over VXLAN tunnels.
* Inter-subnet connectivity within a DataCenter over VXLAN tunnels.
* Intra-subnet connectivity across dataCenters over VXLAN tunnels.
* Inter-subnet connectivity across dataCenters over VXLAN tunnels.

Out of scope
------------

Use Cases
---------

The following high level use-cases will be realized by the implementation of this Spec.

Datacenter access from another Datacenter over WAN via respective DC-Gateways (L2 DCI)
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

This use-case involves providing intra-subnet connectivity between two DataCenters.
Tenant VMs in one datacenter will be able to communicate with tenant VMs on the other
datacenter provided they are part of the same L3VPN and they are on same subnets.

The dataplane between the tenant VMs themselves and between the tenant VMs
towards the DC-Gateway will be over VXLAN Tunnels.

The dataplane between the DC-Gateway to its other WAN-based BGP Peers is
transparent to this spec.  It is usually MPLS-based IPVPN.

The BGP Control plane between the ODL Controller and the DC-Gateway will be
via EVPN RouteType 2 as defined in EVPN_RT2_.

The control plane between the DC-Gateway and it other BGP Peers in the WAN
is transparent to this spec, but can be IP-MPLS.

In this use-case:

1. We will have only a single DCGW for WAN connectivity
2. MAC IP prefix exchange between ODL controller and DC-GW (iBGP) using EVPN RT2
3. WAN control plane will use L3VPN IP-MPLS route exchange.
4. On the DC-Gateway, the VRF instance will be configured with two sets of import/export targets. One set of import/export route targets belong to L3VPN inside DataCenter (realized using EVPN RT5) and the second set of import/export route target belongs to WAN control plane.
5. EVPN single homing to be used in all RT5 exchanges inside the DataCenter i.e., ESI=0 for all prefixes sent from DataCenter to the DC-Gateway.
6. Inter AS option B is used at DCGW, route regeneration at DCGW

Proposed change
===============

The following components of an Openstack-ODL-based solution need to be enhanced to provide
intra-subnet and inter-subnet connectivity across DCs using EVPN IP Prefix Advertisement
(Route Type 2) mechanism (refer EVPN_RT2_):

* Openstack Neutron BGPVPN Driver
* OpenDaylight Controller (NetVirt)
* BGP Quagga Stack to support EVPN with RouteType 2 NLRI
* DC-Gateway BGP Neighbour that supports EVPN with RouteType 2 NLRI

The changes required in Openstack Neutron BGPVPN Driver and BGP Quagga Stack
are captured in the Solution considerations section down below.

      }
    }



Solution considerations
-----------------------

Proposed change in Openstack Neutron BGPVPN Driver
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
The Openstack Neutron BGPVPN’s ODL driver in Newton release needs to be changed, so that
it is able to relay the configured L2 BGPVPNs, to the OpenDaylight Controller.
As of Mitaka release, only L3 BGPVPNs configured in Openstack are being relayed to the
OpenDaylight Controller. So in addition to addressing the ODL BGPVPN Driver changes in
Newton, we will provide a Mitaka based patch that will integrate into Openstack.

The Newton changes for the BGPVPN Driver has merged and is here:
https://review.openstack.org/#/c/370547/

Proposed change in BGP Quagga Stack
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
The BGP Quagga Stack is a component that interfaces with ODL Controller to enable ODL Controller itself
to become a BGP Peer.  This BGP Quagga Stack need to be enhanced so that it is able to embrace EVPN
with Route Type 5 on the following two interfaces:

* Thrift Interface where ODL pushes routes to BGP Quagga Stack
* Route exchanges from BGP Quagga Stack to other BGP Neighbors (including DC-GW).

Proposed change in OpenDaylight-specific features
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The following components within OpenDaylight Controller needs to be enhanced:

* NeutronvpnManager
* VPN Engine (VPN Manager)
* ELAN Manager
* FIB Manager
* BGP Manager

Reboot Scenarios
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This feature support all the following Reboot Scenarios for EVPN:

*  Entire Cluster Reboot
*  Leader PL reboot
*  Candidate PL reboot
*  OVS Datapath reboots
*  Multiple PL reboots
*  Multiple Cluster reboots
*  Multiple reboots of the same OVS Datapath.
*  Openstack Controller reboots


Configuration impact
--------------------
The following parameters have been initially made available as configurable for EVPN. These
configurations can be made via the RESTful interface:

**1.Multi-homing-mode** – For multi-homing use cases where redundant DCGWs are used ODL can be configured with ‘none’, ‘all-active’ or ‘single-active’ multi-homing mode.  Default will be ‘none’.

**2.IRB-mode** – Depending upon the support on DCGW, ODL can be configured with either ‘Symmetric’ or ‘Asymmetric’ IRB mode.  Default is ‘Symmetric’.

There is another important parameter though it won’t be configurable:

**MAC Address Prefix for EVPN** – This MAC Address prefix represents the MAC Address prefix that will be hardcoded and that MACAddress will be used as the gateway mac address if it is not supplied from Openstack.  This will usually be the case when networks are associated to an L3VPN with no gateway port yet configured in Openstack for such networks.


Clustering considerations
-------------------------
The feature should operate in ODL Clustered environment reliably.

Usage
=====

Features to Install
-------------------
This feature can be used by installing odl-netvirt-openstack.
This feature doesn't add any new karaf feature.

REST API
--------
A new rpc is added to create and delete evpn:

.. code-block:: none


   {'input': {
       'l3vpn': [
           {'name': 'EVPN1',
            'export-RT': ['50:2'],
            'route-distinguisher': ['50:2'],
            'import-RT': ['50:2'],
            'id': '4ae8cd92-48ca-49b5-94e1-b2921a260007',
            ‘l2vni’: ‘200’,
            'tenant-id': 'a565b3ed854247f795c0840b0481c699'
   }]}}

There is no change in the REST API for associating networks (or) deleting the EVPN.

On the Openstack-side configuration, the vni_ranges configured in Openstack Neutron ml2_conf.ini
should not overlap with the L3VNI provided in the ODL RESTful API.
In an inter-DC case, where both the DCs are managed by two different Openstack Controller
Instances, the workflow will be to do the following:

1. Configure the DC-GW2 facing OSC2 and DC-GW1 facing OSC1 with the same BGP configuration parameters.
2. On first Openstack Controller (OSC1) create an L3VPN1 with RD1 and L3VNI1
2. On first Openstack Controller (OSC1) create an EVPN1 with RD2 and L2VNI1
3. Create a network Net1 and Associate that Network Net1 to L3VPN1
3. Create a network Net1 and Associate that Network Net1 to EVPN1
4. On second Openstack Controller (OSC2) create an L3VPN2 with RD1 with L3VNI1
4. On second Openstack Controller (OSC2) create an EVPN2 with RD2 with L2VNI1
5. Create a network Net2 on OSC2 with same cidr as the first one with a different allocation pool and associate that Network Net2 to L3VPN2.
5. Create a network Net2 on OSC2 and associate that Network Net2 to EVPN2.
6. Spin-off VM1 on Net1 in OSC1.
7. Spin-off VM2 on Net2 in OSC2.
8. Now VM1 and VM2 should be able to communicate.
