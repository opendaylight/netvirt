      "message": "What is the FindBugs complaint? With OpenFlow a drop rule is an empty action so this might be why this code is the way it is. Maybe we need an override or ignore on these lines with a comment to indicate the reasoning.\n\nOther than that, I think the fix is the actionInfos need to be added to the instructions.",

It will be more apporpriate to set in the instruction\n  instructions.add(new InstructionInfo(InstructionType.write_actions, actionsInfos)); \n\nSimilar error is present in some of the other drop instruction as well due to copy/paste.",
