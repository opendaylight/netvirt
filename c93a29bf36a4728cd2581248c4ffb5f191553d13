      "message": "\"Null pointer dereference of rtr in withdrawPortIpFromVpnIface(Uuid, Port, Subnetmap, WriteTransaction)\"\n\nThis was not caught by reviewers and illustrates why we desperately need FindBugs enabled in all of netvirt. Looks like it should be \"rtr !\u003d null\". I will fix this with https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/#/c/64861/.\n\nIMO we should cease pushing any more new code until FindBugs is enabled.",

      "message": "Hi Tom,\n\ngood match. again, your tool seems to be very efficient.\nI just looked at findbugs web page.\no when you say \"cease pushing any more new code until findbugs is enabled\", you mean automate it in the \"compilation process\", so that if findbugs is firing an alarm, then code is considered as bad. I was wondering if that tool could fire any false positive alarms ?\no when you say \"cease pushing any more new code until findbugs is enabled\", you mean use it. Then how could people that are not using eclipse could use it. Is there a procedure to use it by command line ?\nThanks,",

      "message": "FindBugs has a maven plugin so we enable it to run and fail the build if a violation occurs. See https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/#/c/64861/5/vpnservice/neutronvpn/neutronvpn-impl/pom.xml. It also has a plugin for Eclipse as well that can be run when you save a file (same as Checkstyle). \n\nThis error is reported by the Eclipse compiler as well and I\u0027d think IntelliJ  \nand any other good IDE would as well. Are you using any IDE or just using an editor like vi? If the latter I would strongly suggest using an IDE (Eclipse is free).\n\nIt\u0027s possible FindBugs can flag something that really isn\u0027t an issue (sometimes it can\u0027t tell for sure but warns to be safe) in which case you can use @SuppressFBWarning(\"...\").",
