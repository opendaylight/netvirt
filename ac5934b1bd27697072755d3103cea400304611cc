      "message": "We should refrain from unnecessary null checks. \nHere, there is no possibility that vpnId or the localNextHopIp can be null.\nlocalNextHopIp is nothing but vrfEntry.getDestPrefix(), which is a key for the vrfEntry. This will never be null.\nSimilary, on create the vpnId will never be null, because we already have a Preconditions check for vpnId in createFibEntries(). Please note that if vpnInstance is not null. then vpnId will never be null.\n\nHence, please remove this check and keep it as it was before.",
