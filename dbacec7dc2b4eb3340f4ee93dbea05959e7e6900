      "message": "generally speaking, you should try to avoid using toString() like the plague.  It\u0027s, typically, intended for debugging, only.  It\u0027s usually implemented to return a String representation of any Object that is useful for a human during debugging, and not meant for \"real\" (production) code.  It typically concatenates an object\u0027s fields (properties) into a StringBuilder, and you want to avoid that, if you can.\n\nIn this particular case, I don\u0027t know what exact type pods.getClusterUuid() returns?  There may be a better method on that type... or not.  If it was a java.util.UUID (it\u0027s probably not?), then there is no other method than toString, and it may exceptionally be fine here.  But if it\u0027s a YANG Uuid (ietf.yang.types.rev130715), then use getValue() instead of toString().  \n\nIn an ideal world, it would be much better to just \"use\" only that UUID everywhere, instead of having to convert it to a String, and perhaps back from it again.  That depends on exactly what the code does, of course.  In this case, without knowing much about this, wouldn\u0027t it be better if createElanInstanceForTheFirstPodInTheNetwork() accepted a Uuid arg instead of a String?\n\nHTH ?",
