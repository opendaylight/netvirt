      "message": "I confirmed the interface config getting updated correctly. Genius is taking care of it. Note that with Alon\u0027s changes we won\u0027t really have any parentRefs for this interface because that requires a port on OVS. A subport never had that, so parentRefs will stay null. If this port ends up getting used as VM port [need confirmation if a valid use case] parentRefs will be filled once tap port gets created for it.",

      "message": "Good point Peri - though Vishal is correct in the typical case of trunk_member-\u003etrunk transition we would go from parentRef\u003dTrunk to parentRef\u003dnone, I\u0027m not sure InterfaceConfigListener#update will take care of the interface-child-info DS.. It seems that when the new parentRef is null we just look for a new one - we don\u0027t handle deleting of the previous parent.\n\nThis would probably be more problematic in a case where a port changes from parentRef A to parentRef B directly.",

      "message": "Tested and found to be working. Currently OvsInterfaceConfigUpdatHelper treats any change in any of port attributes/augmentations as remove/add. I believe that remove takes care of deleting previous parent. Trunk API doesn\u0027t have a use case of parentRefA to parentRefB but I think the remove+add should take care of that too. I also checked with Trunk API team on reusing ex-subport and though API does support is, it is not recommended due to potential issues with cleanup.",
