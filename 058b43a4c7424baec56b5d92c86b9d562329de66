      "message": "it would be better not to create this new static method here.. when DataStoreJobCoordinator becomes non-static in https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/#/c/51431/, then this will make it a bit (not much) issue to move to it.  Can I suggest that instead of doing this you write a new implementation of AsyncEventsWaiter, maybe named class JobCoordinatorEventsWaiter implements DataStoreJobCoordinator which does this, and inject that in your test instead?",

      "message": "This doens\u0027t seem right, very wrong.. why is this needed? You seem to hard-coding for this to answer with only the 2nd argument instead of the list.  For a generic Mockito util like this one here, that doesn\u0027t make sense, to me.  Don\u0027t you need to adapt the test using this util instead of hard-coding this generic util to something your test needs following this change?",
