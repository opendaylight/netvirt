Basically say if our callback registration here happened 1msec later than the router-create-notification itself landed from mdsal, would the registry still invoke our callback?",

A new function that just calls same two functions doesn\u0027t make any difference, right?\n\nCallback registration should trigger straightaway if data was written during this time.
