Just wondering if this is something that should be defined higher up, like in odlparent, IFF there is an initial/*.xml (conditional), then do this thing.. just a thought.",

      "message": "Yes, this is how it works today. I am not sure how it would look if in odlparent. The key piece is the file artifact. That is what gets the xml copied to the distribution and seems specific to the bundle so not sure how to make it generic for odlparent. We use this already in aclservice, dhcpservice and neutronvpn. ovsdb might use this also. This then corresponds to the features.xml copy of the config file.",
