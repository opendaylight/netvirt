      "message": "Sorry but I\u0027m not following you here yet - to avoid perpetuating which circular bundle dependencies?  What am I missing if I say that, for the purpose of this change, L2GatewayCacheImpl really could just be put into neutronvpn-impl, without creating a new bundle?  Or is doing this a first step to do more after and subsequently reduce some circular bundle dependencies?  Because this change does not actually seem to remove any dependencies; as far as I gathered, your removal of optional availability on reference import in this change is actually unrelated to having put L2GatewayCacheImpl in a new bundle.  It\u0027s possible that I\u0027m missing something.",

      "message": "yeah no lets avoid optional \u003creference\u003e at all cost; it\u0027s confusing and can \"hide\" start-up errors and could \"misinform\" infrautils.ready and infrautils.diagstatus.  \n\nBut the fact that we need a new bundle just for the cache is probably an indication of a bigger design issue, no? Like if both neutronvpn-impl as well as elanmanager-impl need L2GatewayCache, then... should it perhaps be exposed by either or the other -api? Not sure this makes sense, but something doesn\u0027t seem quite right if we have to introduce a new cache/ bundle.\n\nHaving said that, I don\u0027t want to stand in the way of getting this in as intermediate solution, so I\u0027l +1 it despite some reservation that this is the ideal best later solution.",
