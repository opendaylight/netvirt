      "message": "Sorry but I\u0027m not following you here yet - to avoid perpetuating which circular bundle dependencies?  What am I missing if I say that, for the purpose of this change, L2GatewayCacheImpl really could just be put into neutronvpn-impl, without creating a new bundle?  Or is doing this a first step to do more after and subsequently reduce some circular bundle dependencies?  Because this change does not actually seem to remove any dependencies; as far as I gathered, your removal of optional availability on reference import in this change is actually unrelated to having put L2GatewayCacheImpl in a new bundle.  It\u0027s possible that I\u0027m missing something.",
