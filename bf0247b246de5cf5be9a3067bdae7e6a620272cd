      "message": "You are right but don\u0027t we have the exact same situation in the code today if elan-interface config + ietf-interface state for the same are arriving simultaneously?\n\nWhat I\u0027m saying is that if there are clustering issues between elan and ietf-interface subtree they should be solved for the entire module. Maybe by making all the elan listeners clustered + write only from the ELAN leader but I don\u0027t feel this is something that should be done in the scope of solving regression",

I initially thought about moving the internal tunnel handling to this listener but it seems all synced operations coming from this listener are related only to L2GW/HWVTEP events so I don\u0027t think it would help much to move the code there without changing behavior of all other ELAN listeners on all ext. tunnel related events",
