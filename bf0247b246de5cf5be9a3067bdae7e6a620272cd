      "message": "You are right but don\u0027t we have the exact same situation in the code today if elan-interface config + ietf-interface state for the same are arriving simultaneously?\n\nWhat I\u0027m saying is that if there are clustering issues between elan and ietf-interface subtree they should be solved for the entire module. Maybe by making all the elan listeners clustered + write only from the ELAN leader but I don\u0027t feel this is something that should be done in the scope of solving regression",
