      "message": "The entityOwnershipService is actually unused - it is accessed in isMasterProviderInstance but it\u0027s not called. Also the Module createInstance method calls the no-arg constructor. This is aside from the fact that it\u0027s static (ugh). Not sure what the author\u0027s intent was - maybe they internd to use it. I know this is pre-existing but I say we remove it as it should not be static.",
