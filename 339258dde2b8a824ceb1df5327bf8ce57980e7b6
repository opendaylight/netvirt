      "message": "Yes @Tali, its similar to ARP. For IPv6, when the upstream/external IPv6 Gateway does a Neighbor Solicitation for the router-gateway-ip, controller/ipv6service would respond with a Neighbor Advertisement providing the target link layer address. \n\nCurrently ipv6service supports Neighbor Solicitation for the router-internal-ports (i.e., on the tenant networks), we will be extending this to the router-gateway-ports (on the external network).",
