Unless I\u0027m really missing something, handleunprocessedElanInterfaces via its use of addElanInterface which ends in InterfaceAddWorkerOnElanInterface which does setupEntriesForElanInterface which ends up using ElanUtils.waitForTransactionToComplete is already completely sync anyway, so I\u0027m not sure you really get any perf benefits at scale, do you see what I mean, or am I missing something?",

The intention of having DJ is to sequencing and parallelizing the tasks at different synchronization levels using elan name and elan interface name and reliving dcn thread as early as possible. so are you planning to hold dcn thread till final processing of the event ?",
