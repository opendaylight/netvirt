Per the documentation on this function all it does is program anti-spoofing rules. If this is true, the name of the function can be made much clearer, e.g., programAntiSpoofing or something like that. If not, the comment should be fixed.",

I think it would be more readable if that were consistent.\nAlso, the \"mirror image\" of EGRESS_ACL_SERVICE used in StatefulEgressAclServiceImpl is simply ACL_SERVICE. Perhaps it is worth making it more mirrored, \"INGRESS_ACL_SERVICE\". Overall, it would be better to try for consistency wrt these terms.",
