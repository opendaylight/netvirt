      "message": "This is a backwards incompatible change since you\u0027re removing the router-id leaf. This has potential impact on upgrade for data that is persisted (ie config data store). If that is the case, on upgrade, the previous router-id leaf will be lost and router-ids list will be empty. The potential upgrade implications of these changes should be evaluated and possibly add migration code if need be.",
